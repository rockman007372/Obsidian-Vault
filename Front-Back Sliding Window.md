## Main Points

These ones are different because instead of having both pointers traveling from the front, you have one from the front, and the other from the back.

An example of this is the **Rainwater Problem** where you are calculating the **maximum** amount of rainwater you can capture in a given terrain. Again, you are looking for a maximum value, though the logic is slightly different, you are still optimizing a brute force O(N²) solution.
