## Main Points

- Smart urbanism is sold as an idea capable of ameliorating the gamut of urban maladies like congestion, polution, improving logistical efficiency, boosting productivity and economic competitiveness, more equitable access to services, empower citizens, encourage more transparent and participatory forms of governance, sustainable environmental practices and so on...
- Smart tech are harnessed to realise an efficient, techologically advanced, green and socially inclusive city.
- Smart urbanism also promises more equitable allocation of resources free of political biases based on irrefutatable data → dangerously similar to notions of neoliberalism.

3 themes critical to the success of any smart urbanism project:
- Data-driven feedback loops → Data being privatised and corporatised + having potentials to be manipulated.
- effective public-private ownership
- integrating urbanism of the past, present and future

## Paradoxes in applying smart urbanism in Singapore

Ideology vs Praxis (Application):
- Tech impacts are not evenly distributed
- Tech can compromise privacy, civic freedom and justify tighter gov control (Mobile Digital ID to replace SingPass system)

Efficiency vs Control
- Smart city can helps control the provision of services, it can also involves control over the populance (e-payment) → dataveilance: data collected, stored, analysed and interpreted as public right and not personal freedom.
- eg, smart homes in Yuhua - an HDB estate in Jurong Lake District - had sensors installed on doors to monitor the inactivity of elderly residents. → met with resistance from the elderly.
- On one hand , requires active and compliant participation of citizens; on the other, failure or unwillingless to participation can bring about marginalisation and exclusion.

Access vs Choice
- Increased access to new tech through supportive measures (upskilling and reskilling) to coercions (abolish 2G mobile networks popular among elderly and lower-income group).
- Offer children of the elderly income tax relief if they convince the elderly parents to adopt smart healthcare tech.

Smart Governance vs Smart Citizenship
- Both are need to realise smart urbanism potentials.
- Singapore restructure goverment to be more aligned with tech changes (govTech, SNDGO)
 - Smart citizens have to have the tech skills + see the purpose of upskilling → create division between the high-skilled and the low-skilled → ramification on social-patial integration, national belonging.
- Elderly value human interactions that come with the tech rather than the benefits of tech itself.

## Forthspace

firstspace: material manifestation of everyday life - geographic space
secondspace: symbolic and ideologic representation of space
thirdspace: both material and symbolic, both real and imagined??
fourthspace: intersection of real, imagined and the digital worlds. eg, digital space of bus drivers using bus tracker apps intertwines with the physical space.

## Link to Vietnam

- Da Nang being [named](https://www.eco-business.com/news/da-nang-wins-ibm-grant-to-become-smart-city/) the first of 33 smart cities in the world by IBM Technology Group in 2012. The smart city programme then awarded Da Nang more than $50 million in funding. This programme focuses on ensuring water quality for people, providing the greatest public transportation, and reducing traffic congestion through the deployment of a smart central management solution.
- Vietnam has been an incredible developmental success story in the last few decades. It has maintained high growth and embraced innovation, with an **openness to partnerships between state and private sector, national and international partners.** Smart cities thrive on these connections, building working relationships between civil society, private enterprise, academia and government bodies. As Arup’s work on the Smart Cities Handbook for Vietnam has shown, the growing power of digital offers administrators, innovators and investors with an unparalleled opportunity to make big change happen, to the benefit of everyone.

## Conclusion

Smart urbanism cannot be avoided, it is a natural response to evolving technology.
