A test case design heuristic that is based on the observation that bugs often result from **incorrect handling of boundaries of [[Equivalence Partitioning|equivalence partitions]]**.

BVA suggests that when picking test inputs from an equivalence partition, **values near boundaries (i.e. boundary values) are more likely to find bugs.**
