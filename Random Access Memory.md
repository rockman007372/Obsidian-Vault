RAM stands for **Random Access Memory** and is the physical hardware inside a computer that temporarily stores data, serving as the computer’s “working” memory.

RAM allows a computer to work with more information at the same time, which usually has a considerable effect on total system performance.

RAM is used to provide quick read and write access to a storage device. [Your computer uses RAM to load data because it’s much quicker than running that same data directly off of a hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) [1](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159). Think of RAM like an office desk. A desk is used for quick access to important documents, writing tools, and other items that you need right now. [Without a desk, you’d keep everything stored in drawers and filing cabinets, meaning it would take much longer to do your everyday tasks since you would have to constantly reach into these storage compartments to get what you need, and then spend additional time putting them away](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) [1](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159).

[Unlike a hard drive, which can be powered down and then back on without losing its data, the contents of RAM are always erased when the computer shuts down](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) [1](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159).
