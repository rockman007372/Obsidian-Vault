In SQL, PSM stands for Persistent Stored Modules. PSM is an extension to the SQL standard that allows users to define **stored procedures** and **functions** using a procedural programming language, such as PL/SQL or T-SQL.

PSM provides a way to create more complex and sophisticated database applications that can handle complex operations and calculations. It enables users to write their own custom functions and stored procedures, which can be called and executed within SQL queries or from external applications.

Some common PSM languages include 
- PL/SQL (used in Oracle databases)
- T-SQL (used in Microsoft SQL Server)
- **PL/pgSQL** (PostgreSQL)

In CS2102, we are concerned with [[PL-pgSQL|PL/pgSQL]].
