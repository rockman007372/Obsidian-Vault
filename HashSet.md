# HashSet
### Main Points
Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements Set interface.

The important points about Java HashSet class are:
-   HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism calledÂ **hashing.**
-   HashSet contains unique elements only.
-   HashSet allows null value.
-   HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
-   HashSet is the **best approach for search operations.**
