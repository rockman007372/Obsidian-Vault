Express.js is a popular open-source **web application framework for Node.js**. It provides a set of features and utilities for building web applications and APIs, such as routing, middleware, and templates.

## Difference to Node.js

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, while Express.js is a **web application framework** that runs on top of Node.js.

Node.js provides the core functionality and features for running JavaScript on the server, such as handling I/O operations, managing events, and interacting with the file system and network services. Express.js, on the other hand, provides a set of tools and utilities for building web applications and APIs on top of Node.js, including routing, middleware, and templates.
