### Introduction
- Little changes make big differences in the long run. Success is a product of daily habits. Patience is required.
- Forget about goals, focus on system instead 
	- Both successful and failed people share similar goals but not everyone can achieve them.
	- Goals are binary, either you achieve it or you do not.
	- After completing your goals, what's next?
- Even if you have goals, dont focus on the outcome, but on your identity. You will feel compelled to live up to your identity.
	- Dont aim to run a marathon, aim to be a runner
	- Dont aim to play a song well, aim to be a good guitarist.
- The Habit Feeback Loop: Try to modify any of these 4 stages to break habit!
	1. Cue: Staying up date -> Stop staying up late
	2. Craving: Hungry -> Eat more food, eat later 
	3. Response: Buy food -> Sleep or eat healthier food
	4. Reward: Feel full -> Remind yourself you are fat af

### Laws
##### Make It Obvious
- List out and keep track all your little habits -> Notice the cues that lead to bad habits.
- Time and Location are important cues to have when setting habits
	- Instead of "work out", say "going to Utown Gym at 5pm"
- Habit-stacking: After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit].
	- After I brush my teeth, I will stretch and tone.
- Make positive cue obvious and vice versa.
	- To drink more water, place waterbottle nearby.
	- To focus, place phone far away from study space.

##### 2. Make It Attractive
- Dopamine surges before taking actions (like eating junk food or taking drugs). The anticipation of a reward drives dopamine -> Use dopamine to your advantage to build habit.
- Temptation bundling: Bundle something you need to do with something you want to do. 
	- After 2 hours of studying, you can play one match of Valorant.
- Surround yourself with people following the same habits.
	- Gym with friends
- Rewire habits to make it aligns with positive outcomes
	- Gym not to get big. Gym to be fit and prevent injuries.

##### 3. Make It Easy
- The law of least effort: Increase fictions for bad habits and reduce fictions for good habits
	- Make junk food incredibly hard to obtain (do not store junk food at home, lock wallet and credit cards away somewhere so you cannot buy online).
	- Lay out work out clothes the day before.
- The **2-Minute habit**: Scale down design outcome
	- To gym, just aim on wearing shoes
	- To shower, aim to wash face

##### 4. Make It Satisfying
- Crucial in making habits stick.
>[!Reminder]
> What is immediately rewarded is repeated. 
> What is immediately punised is avoided.

- Bad habit feels good short-term, but bad long-term. The opposite is true for good habits (bad short-term, good long-term). => We have to add pains to bad habits and pleasures to good habits in the short run.
- Reward yourself and feel successful:
	- It is satisfying to make progress, so make visual measurements of your progress!
	- Have a habit tracker to keep track and feel accomplished
- When you have a bad day, DO NOT BREAK HABIT. Just do the bare minimum even if its not effective.
	- If you are injured, just go to the gym and do sth light.
	- If you are tired, just do 10 pushups instead of 100.
- Have an accountability partner and a habit contract. 
	- Whenever you break a habit, inform the partner and pay the punishment stated in contract.
