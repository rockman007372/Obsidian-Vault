## Main Points

The absence of political opposition shields the government and the civil service from public pressures. However, instead of allowing this insulation to encourage corruption, the government has been able to mold the civil service and other statutory bodies into agencies of development, to capitalize on the stability provided by the unchanging regime to set and **implement long-term plans** without intermittent disruptions caused by changes in government, factors that have been fundamental to Singapore’s economic success.

### Global city
Singapore establishes themselves as a global city that focuses on export-oriented industrialization.

### Success Story
Singapore makes success a core identity. Economic success has become the emblem of the nation. Singapore has become a brand for its citizens and business to leverage on when working overseas. 

Should the economy cease to grow or, worse, regress, PAP’s legitimacy of absolute dominance in political power would be severely disrupted. This may explain the PAP government’s addiction to growth, to limitless accumulation of wealth in national reserves which are invested globally for further accumulation.

Nevertheless, Singapore has still become a model for other countries to emulate (especially Asian countries):
- Tony Blair, UK prime minister, attempted to introduce CPF
- Bush government also tried to introduce CPF
- Singapore's electronic road pricing system studied by London and New York

### Singapore as a model
Bangalore tried to emulate Singapore as they consider their economic success to be repeatable, realizable due to the common legacy of colonial rule, and the common Asian society with similar social features.

China under late Deng Xiaoping also consulted Singapore for their urban planning expertise and knowledge to build many urban projects such as:
- Suchou Industrial Park near Shanghai, in 1992
- Sino-Tianjin Eco-City project, initiated in 2008, where Singapore’s planning practices are being combined experimentally with new technologies of urban sustainability

China also sent officials to Singapore for special programs to learn about city government practices.

### Discrete lessons - Why Singapore is successful
Reasons for economic success:
- Cold war setting, red scare → PAP can suppress political parties to hold onto power
- According to George Yeo, Singapore’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and current PAP ideologue, “Our success is the result of anxiety, and the anxiety is never fully assuaged by success.” → The contingency of success is ideologically used both to warn and to motivate Singaporeans not to take success for granted, as success gets incorporated into the Singaporean identity. Singapore and Singaporeans are to stay competitive permanently, as development is likened to an “unending marathon'

Impossible to replicate singapore success because of the unique historical conditions that force Singapore to fight for survival constantly as it did.

I gave up :(
