## Midterm

To take note:
- PCB: what exactly is hardware context? stores value of registers being executed, saved for context-switching
- Signals: a form of communication between processed to tell other processes that an event occurred.	
- Difference between signal and exception:
	- Signals are sent and handled by different processes to tell them an event occured.
	- Exceptions and interrupts are the events themselves, usually handled by the same process?
