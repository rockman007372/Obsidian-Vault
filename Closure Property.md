>[!definition]
> A set of values is closed under the set of operators if any combinations of the operators produce only values in the given set.

Eg:
- $Z^{+}$ is closed under $\set{+}$ but not under $\set{+, -}$

> [!Theorem]
> Relations are closed under Relational Algebra. 

Implication: We can **chain operations** because all input and outputs are relations.
