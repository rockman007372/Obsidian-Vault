**Me, te, se, nos, os, se** are all examples of reflexive pronouns in Spanish. They are used to indicate that the subject is performing the action on itself.

-   Me: myself
-   Te: yourself (informal singular)
-   Se: himself/herself/itself/yourself (formal singular)
-   Nos: ourselves
-   Os: yourselves (informal plural)
-   Se: themselves/yourself (formal plural)

They must go with **reflexive verbs**.

Examples:
- Me llamo Nathan (llamarse)
- Me desayuno: I have breakfast (desayunarse)
- Me ducho: I shower myself (ducharse)
