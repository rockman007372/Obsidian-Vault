## Mind-dependent vs Mind-independent morality

- Morality and value may or may not be independent with the mind.
	- The value of chocolate lie in the fact that people like eating it. If all humans dislike chocolate, we would not miss out on an independent fact about chocolate's value => chocolate's value is mind-dependent.
	- The questions is whether **all** values/morals are dependent on the mind.
- Mind-dependent theorists say yes. 
	- According to [[Does Anything Really Matter or Did We Just Evolve to Think So|Sharon Street]], morality and values are mind-dependent (no mind-independent ~~universa~~l truth **regarding morals and values**).
- Mind-independent theorists say no.
	- It is not clear whether [[The Challenge of Cultural Relativism|James Rachels]] thinks moral norms are mind-independent or not.
	- He only claims that there must be at least some universal truths regarding morality.

# Question

- If morality is indeed mind-dependent, does it mean there is truly cultural relativism?
	- NO! Even when morality is mind-dependent, it can still be universal.
	- Cultural relativism claims that there are no universal moral truths. Morality is dependent on culture.
	- However, according to a mind-dependent view, there can still be universal moral truths. Some societies, after careful reflection, may realise that their morality is false and adopt the same universal truths of other society.
