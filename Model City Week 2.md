## Readings

* [[Singapore as Model - Planning Innovations, Knowledge Experts]]


## Notes

What is a model? 
- Ideals, structure
- Good examples to emulate
- Root word: modulus (a small measure, standard)
- A representation, a likeness of sth (model plane toy)
- A representative form, pattern or style

### Singapore Models after Others?

Where is Greek and Roman architecture in Singapore? Civic district

Where can you find Chinese, Malay, European model all rolled into one building? Katong shophouses

Who do we model our legal system after? British common law

The other Merlion statue in Asia?  Surabaya, Indonesia

Tiajin's eco-city in China

### Lim's Model City Criteria

1. Accessible city
2. Business city
3. Attractive city
4. City for living 

### Singapore as a projection of Models

Cities are layered with competing models within themselves.

Socialist vs capitalist planning models? 

The model vs the unique? Singapore model seems not replicable

Paradoxes - Think of city as a model and not a model

### Discussion questions

1. What kind of city model is offered by the Greek polis? What aspects of social life and organization made the polis possible? Can we apply such concepts to Singapore?

- High rise vs low rise?
- Lack of a sense of community in Singapore
- Social engineering to bring about interactions (engineering social interactions): HDB racial quotas
- Social media and online space reduces physical interactions, online community.


2. Is Lim's model of Singapore accurate and why? How is Lim's Singapore as model similar or different from Chua's version?

3. Does Singapore make a good model for other cities? What challenges?

- City state: Singapore is less of a city and more of a state - no other cities have so much governance powers to control borders and immigration intakes...
- Land use: No motherland, needs to allocate lands for other state purposes (defense) -> juggles both city needs but state needs as well.
- Trust in the government! Singapore gov is know to be least corrupted, allowing them to stay in power because they are doing a good job of prosperising the country. â†’ is it rhetoric? There is no transparency. Politicians are paid handsomely.
