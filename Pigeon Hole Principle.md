The **pigeon hole principle** states that if n items are put into m containers, with _n_ > _m_, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

##### Example

Question: Do any two people in London have the same number of hairs on their head?

Answer: Yes. The number of people in London > max number of hairs on a person's head => there must be some people who share the same number of hairs.
