We exploit [[Locality Principles|locality principles]] in our Page Replacement Algorithm to prevent thrashing:
- **Temporal Locality:** After a page is loaded to physical memory, it is likely to be accessed in near future (loops) â‡’ keep more recent pages and remove earlier pages since they probably will not be needed soon.
- **Spatial Locality:** A page contains contiguous locations that is likely to be accessed in near future (neighboring code instructions)

Common Strategies:
1. Optimal Solution - similar to [[Optimal Caching]]
2. [[FIFO Replacement]]
3. [[Least Recently Used Replacement]]
4. [[Second-Chance Replacement]]
