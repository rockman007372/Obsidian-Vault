### Questions
- Public key: 
	- can we encrypt using private key and decrypt with public key? Is this a property of any public key, or only RSA?
	- when a sender encrypts with public key, does receiver need both keys to decrypt, or only private key?
- When key length for symmetric-key is 112, the corresponding recommended length for digest is at least 224. Why the digest length is twice larger? (birthday attack)
- does encryption reduce size of file? NO
