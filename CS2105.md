## To Take Note from Quizzes / Past Year Paper

- [ ] IP header has a checksum that does checksum only on the IP header itself. When datagram goes through NAT router, the checksum also changes.
- [ ] Utilization formula: rate of transmission / (rate of transmission + RTT)
- [ ] When transmission is bit by bit, and there is bottleneck
- [ ] Why use IP over MAC: Hierarchy Routing from subnet to subnet. 
- [ ] decrypting with an incorrect key always gives a non-null result
- [ ] TCP also uses pipelining and buffer and sliding windows!
- [ ] ARP tables has no entries for nodes from other subnets
- [ ] switches dont have mac address (transparent)
- [ ] In VOIP adaptive playout, silence is compressed / lengthened. TALK SPURTS ARE CONSTANT
- [ ] FEC: Forward error correction for VOIp
- [ ] TCP sender has one timer for the oldest unACK packet.
- [ ] For router question where first link is faster than 2nd link, calculate time for first packet to come to R, then the time for all packets in R to go to B.
