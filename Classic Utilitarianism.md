- A right action is the action that maximises **total net pleasure or happiness**.
- Number of people an action benefits does not matter. Only the net pleasure matters.
- Impartial: everyone's pleasure and pain are equal, regardless of class, gender, race, species....
	- Implication: It is morrally wrong for Bill Gates to donate to children in the US instead of children in developing countries.
- ! Demanding: Only the action that maximize total net pleasure is right (all others are wrong)
	- Morally right = morally required 
	- Exception: 2 actions maximize the same amount of net pleasure, you can choose btw the 2 (not morally required to pick one, but to pick at least one).
	- Doesnt care about violating rights, as long as net pleasure increases (even torture is right)
- Counter-arguments as thought experiments:
	- torture person vs finding bomb?
	- shut down soccer games or eletrify?
	- Rebuttal: there are indirect consequences that can affect net pleasure
