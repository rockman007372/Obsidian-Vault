Here's how JavaScript can handle concurrent operations:

1. JavaScript runs a piece of code (this code is running on the main thread).
2. When an async operation is encountered (like setTimeout, fetch, etc.), JavaScript sets it up and then continues running the rest of the code. It doesn't wait for the async operation to complete. This async operation might be running in the background but not on the main JavaScript thread.
3. When the async operation completes, its callback function is placed into the task queue.
4. Once the call stack is empty (i.e., all the code in the current turn of the Event Loop has been executed), the Event Loop takes the first task from the task queue and pushes it onto the call stack, which immediately executes it.
5. This process continues, with the Event Loop pushing tasks from the task queue onto the call stack whenever the call stack is empty, allowing JavaScript to handle multiple operations concurrently despite being single-threaded.
