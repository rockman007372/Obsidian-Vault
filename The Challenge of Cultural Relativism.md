Rachels tried to debunk cultural relativism. He first criticize the argument of cultural relativism, then gave his own arguments as to why it is not true.

## Criticism of common cultural relativism argument

>[!common argument]
> P1: Different cultures have different moral codes.
> C: Cultural relativism is true.

- Lacking one premise: if P1, then C.
- Not a valid argument. 
- e.g. flat earther disagrees with scientist. Does not mean geographical truth is relative.

## Arguments for why cultural relativism is wrong

>[!argument framework]
> P1. If cultural relativism is true, then `[implication]`. 
> 
> P2. It is not the case that `[implication]`. 
> 
> C. Therefore, cultural relativism is not true.


3 such implications:
1. customs of other societies are never morally inferior to us (anti-semitic).
2. we can judge the morality of an action based on the contemporary society standards (racism/segregation is okay since it is acceptable in the past).
3. moral progress is impossible (woman rights).

## Counter arguments against Rachels

Since Rachel arguments are valid, opponents can only attack its soundness. In other word, **attack its premises**.

1. Bite the bullet: Accept that implication 2 is true, no matter how counter-intuitive it is.
2. Attack implication 1, 2 and 3 by claiming that cultural customs/practices are different from their **society ideals**. 
	1. One society can be inferior if it fails to live up to its ideals.
	2. Cannot decide morality based on standards of society because these standards might not be ideals
	3. Moral progress is possible (society more aligned to its ideals)

## What can we learn from Cultural relativism

- It gives us the insight that some practices are cultural products (burial vs cremation).
- However, it wrongly concludes that since some practices are cultural product, all must be => there are some universal moral rules shared among society (value the life of infants).
	- Is Eskimos wrong in killing their babies? Yes, but it is justifiable.
		- Life conditions force them to make choices that we dont have to.
		- However, they still value their babies. Else, how can their society survive?

> [!conclusion]
> There are **some** moral rules that all societies will have in common, because those rules are necessary for society to exist.
