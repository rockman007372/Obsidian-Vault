$R_x$ = {$x_1, x_2, x_{3,}...$}

For each x $\in$ $R_x$, there is a probability that X takes this value: 
P($X = x_i$) $\geq 0$

>**Probability function** (p.f) of X: 
$f(x) = P(X = x)$

The collection of pairs $(x_i, f(x_i))$ for i = 1, 2, 3... is called the **probability distribution** or **probability mass function** of X.

Some properties:
