PL/pgSQL is a procedural language extension for [[PostgreSQL]]. It provides a set of features that enable the creation of complex database **functions, triggers, and stored procedures.**

Benefits:
- allows developers to encapsulate complex business logic and calculations within the database itself, rather than relying on external applications or scripts. 
- This can lead to better performance and simpler code maintenance.
