## What is Integration

**Combining parts of a software product to form a whole is called _integration_**. It is also one of the most troublesome tasks and it rarely goes smoothly.

## Build Automation Tools

**Build automation tools automate the steps of the build process, usually by means of build scripts.**

In a non-trivial project, building a product from its source code can be a complex multi-step process. Some of these build steps such as compiling, linking and packaging, are already automated in most modern IDEs. However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.  Some popular build tools relevant to Java developers: [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/), [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Dependency Management Tools

Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important part of build automation. Dependency management tools can automate that aspect of a project.
