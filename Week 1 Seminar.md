##### What is intelligence?
Can you solve problems without understanding deeply?

Intelligence is the ability to take on new skills quickly and naturally? Adaptability? Innate ability?

Or is it the mastery of a concept or a field?

Does rigidly defining intelligence puts a ceiling on one's potential?

Ability to learn vs mastery? 

[[Alpha Go]] vs Alpha Go 0? An AI that plays board game Go

Answers: *Potential!* How likely are we going to attain mastery of a field? 

What does society value in intelligence? Adaptability? Hard work? Fast but less skilled learner or slower but eventually more skilled?

Any test to measure innate intelligence? WHY do we have to measure innate intelligence? To meet better educational needs? To find the next genius? Will it promote fixed mindset attitude? ceiling? 

P3, already have streaming. 

Experiment: see whether babies prefer which language? French or Russion? -> French

IQ test was orginially to identify dumber people to allocate more resources for them.

Foxes vs Hedgehogs:
> Adopting the appealing distinction of the Greek poet Archilochus, one can contrast those who view all intellect as a piece (let us dub them the "hedgehogs") with those who favor its fragmentation into several components (the "foxes"). The hedgehogs not only believe in a singular, inviolable capacity that is the special property of human beings: often, as a corollary, they impose the conditions that each individual is born with a certain amount of intelligence, and that we individuals can in fact be rank-ordered in terms of our God-given intellect or IQ. So entrenched is this way of thinking-and talking-that most of us lapse readily into rankings of individuals as more or less "smart," "blight," "clever," or "intelligent"

Cancer as an analogy to intelligence: Cancer is catagorized as locations or are they all the same cancers?

Is knowledge = intelligence? How do you test a baby? Baby learns really fast, are they the most intelligent? Is it not all about perspective? Definition of intelligence should be fluid, in depends on context.

Is intelligence socially defined? When we see intelligence, are we referring to different types of intelligence? Gardner and IQ researchers may have different definition of intelligence. 

When you are intelligent at programming, is it a consequence of being intelligent at logics and mathematics? I mean obviously, you are coding out the logics for computers to follow.
