## Notes

Looking at visible and invisible aspects and effects of Singapore's urban landscape.

Singapore as a global city, Renaissance city, Smart Nation....

Where do these models come from?
How do they impact us and those outside of out borders?
What are the gaps between what is presented, perceived, represented and lived?
What are the invisible aspects of our urban environment & planning?
What roles do we play in shaping the city?

The self if political - can I link my self-identity to the urban designs of the city?

What is an invisible architecture system that can impact me and make decision on my behalf? AI system? Computer system? → social media feeds

The production of Space (1974)
- social space = perceived space + conceived space + lived space (where social relationship happens, common lounge, dining areas....)
- Space is a precondition and the result of social relations of production → capitalism prioritises ownership, create unequal access to social space
- Spatial inequalities result from the commodification of space 
- Right to the city = Excercise of collective power to change ourselves by reshaping the city

Long-term Plan Review: Singapore's longterm plan shape and guide the development of Singapore, mapping out land uses and infrastructure needs over the next 50 years and beyond.
