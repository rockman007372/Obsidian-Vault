Let me add my views of other aspects.\n\nFrankly, if you could get A/A+, you would have already gotten. Some people are just wired in a way that they can perform well in all assessments in school setting. Just let them win this game. Rather than trying to spend 80% of effort to squeeze out the 20% (the extra 0.5 grade point), you will benefit so much more from doing pet project, training leetcode, joining relevant cca and grinding internship.\n\nToo many of us are entrapped in the ideas of getting perfect grades due to our past 2 decades of education (psle, olevel, a level). Imo, at the stage of uni, it is not worth that much effort for the extra grade that donâ€™t really help you in the career.\n\nMaybe it is time to take a step back and find the most efficient allocation of time.","x":-960,"y":-1080,"width":1340,"height":331},
