Query is a fast, small, and feature-rich **JavaScript library** designed to simplify [[Client-side Scripting]] of HTML. It was released in 2006 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use today. jQuery *provides a wide range of features and functions that can be used to simplify common tasks* like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX.

Some of the key features of jQuery include:

-   DOM manipulation: jQuery makes it easy to select and manipulate HTML elements using a simple syntax that is similar to CSS selectors.
-   Event handling: jQuery provides a simple way to attach event handlers to HTML elements, making it easy to respond to user interactions like clicks and keystrokes.
-   Animation: jQuery includes a wide range of animation functions that can be used to add visual effects to HTML elements, such as fading, sliding, and animating.
-   [[AJAX]]: jQuery simplifies the process of making AJAX requests, allowing developers to easily load data from the server without having to write complex JavaScript code.
