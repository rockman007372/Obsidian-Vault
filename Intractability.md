**Computational tractability** refers to the feasibility of solving a problem using computational resources such as time and memory. 

A problem is considered computationally tractable if there exists an algorithm that can solve it within polynomial time as input size increases.

Problems are classified based on their tractability. Here are the key classifications:

1. **Polynomial Time (P):** Problems for which a solution can be found in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input. These problems are considered tractable.

2. **Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP):** Problems for which a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time. While finding a solution (if it exists) might be hard, verifying a given solution is easy. The famous P vs NP problem asks whether every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time.

3. **NP-Complete:** The hardest problem in NP. Every problem in NP can be reduced to these problems.

4. **NP-Hard:**

5. **Exponential Time (EXP):** Problems for which the solution time grows exponentially with the input size. Solving these problems becomes infeasible for large inputs.
