A library is a collection of **modular code** that is general and can be used by other programs.

>[!example]
> Java classes you get with the JDK (e.g., `String`, `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.) are **library classes** that are provided in the default Java distribution.

To use libraries:
1.  Download the library and make it accessible to your project. Alternatively, you can configure your dependency management tool to do it for you.
2.  Call the library [[API]] from your code where you need to use the library's functionality.
