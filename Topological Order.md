> Topological order is a **sequential total order** such that all edges point forward.

Note:
- If a graph has a topological order, it is a [[Directed Acylic Graph|DAG]] (directed graph with no cyclic dependencies).
- If a graph is a DAG, it has a topological order.
- Topological order is not unique.
