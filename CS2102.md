## Take notes of exam

- Be careful of BCNF decomposition algo (all the attributes in closure, not only one attribute!)
- To check if a decomposed schema is in 3NF, you must project and find the **keys** of the decomposed table first! (heuristic: if all attributes are prime, schema is in 3NF)
- To check if a decomposition is in 3NF, you can derive minimal basis, and see if each FD attributes are in any decomposed table.
- To find if a decomposition is FD-preserving, find minimal basis then check LHS vs RHS
- To check which FD is preserved, project then check. Can you some heuristics:
	- If all attributes remain in the table, preserved
	- If a key is in every decomposed tables, that key is preserved
- misconception about ER diagram: if an entity participates in a relationship, there must be another entity at the other end! An entity cannot be participating in the (binary) relationship alone. 
- Be careful if a relationship set has a prime attribute.
