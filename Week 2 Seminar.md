# Week 2 Seminar

## Questions/Cues

## Notes

###### How do you know how intelligent you are?
How do you measure intelligence?
- In comparison with others
- Grades
- Social cues
- In collaboration project
- A quiz at the end of a lesson -> See who grasp concepts faster

Impossible to remove all the experiences (acquired knowledge) before testing.

How you do well for a test depends on preparation as well, cannot be separated.

Intelligence is determined by society we live in (How fast you calculate was more valuable in the past).

Measurement being relative - How intelligent i am depends on how intelligent others are.

Should we judge intelligence based on subjective perception of yourself? 

Study: teachers tell students either they will succeed vs they will fail -> Those who were told to succeed were more likely to succeed! -> Teacher's perception had a major impact.

Abstract thinking and creativity are very hard to test.

WHY ARE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ARE MORE SUCCESFUL IN OUR SOCIETY?
Could it be because society rewards you for being traditionally intelligent? Universities select booksmart, "traditionally smart" people, who in turn gain access to much more resources and connections which aid them in their future success! â†’ Positive feedback loop
