# CS2100

## Things I took note from doing papers

- For the converting function to multiplexer, just write out all the outputs to see patterns easier
- Only R instruction uses function code
- Draw boxed between the current instruction and right above the target instruction, then count the number of instructions in between.
- For beq instruction, be very careful with data dependecy. 
- `andi t0, t0, 0xF` means `t0 = t0 % 16`
- For half adder: S is xor, C is and
- Delayed branch: Bring instruction in front forward!
- Cannot write to register 0
- mem read and mem write cannot be both 1
- Be careful of LRU for instruction cache (Least recent cache)
- Without data forwarding, instruction at 2 ins away can still be affected. However, if there is a delay before that, it will incur no delay.
- **PI must be max size**, EPI covers the uncovered exclusive 1.

### Tips
- View all lecture  recordings and do all the quizzes for `Week n` before the start of `Week n+1`.
	- I.e. view all the lectures and do the quizzes for Week 1  before the start of Week 2.
