### Main Points
Internet backbones (physical cables) carry information between the client (users) and the Server (each website has a server)

When a client request to see a website, the request is received by Internet Service Provider which looks up the website's IP address from the DNS Server and pass it back to the client.

The client's browser then sends a request to the server at destination IP address. The request is sent through the ISP, which sends it through the Internet Backbone to the Server.

The Server returns information through the same route to the client.
