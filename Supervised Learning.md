Supervised Learning is the machine learning approach defined by its use of **labeled** datasets to **classify data and predict outcomes.**

**Goal** of supervised ML: 

> Given a **training set** of N example input-output pairs $(x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_2), \text{...}$ where each $y_j$ is generated by an unknown $x_j$ through a function $y = f(x)$, **discover a function h that approximates** the true function f.

Major classes of Supervised Learning:
- **Classification**: Predict results in a **discrete** output, map input variables into discrete categories → Spam detection
- **Prediction**: Predict results within a **continuous** output, map input variables to some continuous function → Predicting housing price given area
