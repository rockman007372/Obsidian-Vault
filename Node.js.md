Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, **JavaScript runtime environment** that **allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser**. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used in the Google Chrome web browser, and it provides a number of features that make it well-suited for server-side development.

Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to **write server-side code that can interact with databases, file systems, and network services**. It provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that enables developers to write scalable, high-performance applications that can handle a large number of simultaneous connections.

Node.js includes a built-in package manager, **npm**, which provides access to a vast array of third-party libraries and modules that can be used to build web applications, APIs, and other types of software. Node.js also provides a number of built-in modules for working with HTTP, file systems, and other core components of server-side development.

Overall, Node.js has become a popular choice for building web applications and APIs due to its ease of use, scalability, and performance.

Key features:

- Node.js runs on JavaScript. Allow fast and scalable website.
- Take JavaScript out of the browser, allow codes to interact directly with pc hardware. → write server applications. 
- ! Users send queries to server → Server runs JavaScript code using Node.js to process their request → Server sends result back and display info
- User Browsers dont have to do all the heavy lifting of processing the code!
