Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, **JavaScript runtime environment** that **allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser**. 

Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to **write server-side code that can interact with databases, file systems, and network services**. 

Node.js includes a built-in package manager, **npm**, which provides access to a vast array of third-party libraries and modules.

Key features:

- Node.js runs on JavaScript. Allow fast and scalable website.
- Take JavaScript out of the browser, allow codes to interact directly with pc hardware. → write server applications. 
- ! Users send queries to server → Server runs JavaScript code using Node.js to process their request → Server sends result back and display info
- User Browsers dont have to do all the heavy lifting of processing the code!
