## Quiz 1 and 2

- A program with multiple threads can run successfully over a distributed memory system => true

- Threads cannot access various parts of the matrixes because cannot load to mem => FALSE
	- WHY?

- CUDA may be slower because matrix has to be copied to host's mem, then to device mem.

- cache coherence is the property that multiple caches contain the same set of items => false, no need for same set. Just ensure that a PU's update to the same mem address will propagate to the caches of all other PU. same cache line accessed by multiple PUs are synchronized
