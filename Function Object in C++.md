A function object, also known as a functor, is a C++ construct that allows objects to be used as if they were functions. In C++, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables. Function objects take this concept further by allowing any object to behave like a function.

Here's a basic example of a function object:

```c plus plus
#include <iostream>

// Define a function object class
class MyFunctor {
public:
    // Overload the function call operator ()
    void operator()() const {
        do_sth();
        do_sth_else();
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an instance of the function object
    MyFunctor myFunctor;

    // Call the function object as if it were a function
    myFunctor();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `MyFunctor` is a class that overloads the `operator()` function. This makes instances of `MyFunctor` callable like functions.
- In `main()`, we create an instance of `MyFunctor` named `myFunctor`.
- We then call `myFunctor()` as if it were a function. This invokes the `operator()` function of the `myFunctor` object.

Function objects are useful in scenarios where you want to encapsulate behavior that can be invoked like a function but **may also require some internal state to be maintained across calls**. They are commonly used in algorithms like `std::sort()` and `std::transform()`, where you can pass custom behavior using function objects or lambdas.
