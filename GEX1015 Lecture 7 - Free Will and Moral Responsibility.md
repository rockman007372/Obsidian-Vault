[[Do we possess free will]]

# Content
## Determinism

## Argument Against Free Will

P1. Determinism is either true or false.
P2. If determinism is true, we have no free will (hence moral responsibility)
P3. If determinism is false, we **also** have no free will.
C. Hence we have no free will either way.

Compatibilists deny P2: Determinism is true and we can still have free will.

Libertarians deny P3: Determinism is false and we can still have free will.

## Extension

- Compatibilists cannot deny the premise "If god exists, there will be no evil"
	- Counter-argument: Evil is a necessary product of free will.
	- compatibilist: even if you dont have any alternative choices, you still have moral responsibility/free will.
	- God could have created a deterministic world with no evils, and human can still have free will.
