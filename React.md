React is a popular **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces (UIs) in web applications. It was developed by Facebook and released as an open-source project in 2013. React uses a **declarative approach to building UI components**, which makes it easier to reason about and maintain complex user interfaces.

At its core, React allows developers to create **reusable UI components that can be composed to build complex user interfaces**. React components are written in JavaScript and can be used to build UI elements like buttons, forms, and tables. React components can also be used to build entire pages or applications.

One of the key features of React is its use of a **virtual DOM** ([[Document Object Model]]). The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM that allows React to efficiently update and render UI components. When a user interacts with a React component, React updates the virtual DOM and compares it to the previous version of the virtual DOM to determine which parts of the actual DOM need to be updated. This approach **minimizes the number of DOM manipulations** required, which can lead to **significant performance improvements.**
