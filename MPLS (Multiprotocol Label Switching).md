MPLS is a high-performance, scalable network protocol that uses **short path labels** instead of IP addresses to make data forwarding decisions:

- avoid complex lookups in routing table
- convert routed network to a switched network (faster). 
- paths are established based on source-destination pairs instead of hop-by-hop basis

MPSL header is located between link and network layer header:
