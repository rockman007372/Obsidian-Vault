## Requirements

The essay (2000-2500 words) is your major piece of individual work in this module and constitutes 30% of your total grade. It is **due 19 Feb (Sun), 23:59 hrs.**
  
Your essay should have a clearly stated, appropriately scoped topic that is **of interest and relevance to the course**. This may mean building on one of the weekly themes or **researching something not discussed in depth during class**. You may book an essay consultation session with your lecturer during Weeks 5. Your essay topic must be approved by your lecturer to ensure you do not go out of point.  
  
In preparation for your essay, you should think about the mode of its inquiry, i.e., how you are going to carry out the essay. For example, you may wish to critically review literature or sources about Singapore as a (e.g., model, global, smart or Renaissance) city; you may wish to write about **paradoxes and contradictions with regards to a specific topic of relevance** (e.g. inequality vis-à-vis Singapore’s status as a global city) or use a case study of your choice to critically unpack the theme (e.g. impact of art censorship on Singapore’s ambition to be a Renaissance city). Alternatively, you may want to highlight cross-cutting issues or make comparative studies between Singapore and another city (e.g. adoption and attitude towards “smart” technologies in different smart cities). Finally, you may also look at **connections between different themes** covered in the seminar (e.g., urban play as a strategy for Singapore as a Renaissance city).  
  
In writing your essay, remember to have a clear thesis and substantiate your arguments by presenting specific examples when you make certain claims or points. Any connection you wish to make between the theoretical framework and the particular topic of your choice must be clearly explained and elaborated on. **Do not make the essay wholly descriptive**. Rather, you  should aim to make your essay **analytical**, such as by **drawing selectively and appropriately on your references** and highlighting certain points for critical discussion.  
  
Do give your essay a suitable title and include your name, the course title, word count and referencing style you used on the front page. You may use MLA, APA or Chicago referencing style.  Refer to [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/resources.html) on the different referencing style. The 2000-2500 word-count is **all-inclusive** (essay, captions (if any), and Bibliography).

**Precarity of Singapore's foreign talent in the globalised Singapore**

**Outline:**

Intro:
-        Provide some info on singapore status as a global city and its policies towards international students and foreign talents
-        Briefly introduce the dilemmas faced by internation students in singapore, a subset of foreign talents that are often overlooked in the skilled vs unskilled immigrant’s debate: the paradox of globalisation – foreign students are enticed to come to Singapore for education yet met with strict employment policies and immigration regulations after graduation.
-        State the purpose and scope of the essay: to highlight the precarity as a result of the clash between globalisation-centric approach and stricter immigration policies.

Para 1: The global city and the globalisation of education
-        Define the concept of the global city and how it relates to the internationalization of higher education
-        Role of international students in the global city, including their economic (and social?) contributions
-        Source:  https://journals-sagepub-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/doi/full/10.1177/0002764216632831?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider

Para 2: Precarity of international undergraduates in Singapore
1.  Job insecurity:
-        Changing immigration policies that favour local due to backlash
-        Lack of connections
-        The nature of a global city and globalisation itself -> deemed as fungibles for domestic talent, viewed as flexible part of the market -> paradox arise
-        Capricious economic developments: Covid, tech layoffs

2.  Accommodation and residence uncertainty
-        Hard to become pr, expensive housing, no hdb subsidies

3.  Animosity from local
-        Can link to differential inclusion?
-        Restrictive visa policies, job insecurities, competition for jobs
-        Examples and stats?
-        Covid-19 impacts? Recent layoff in tech industry
-        Sources: [https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2020.1732618](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2020.1732618)  and  https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2019.1648847

Para 3: Link between precarity and global city status?
-        How the focus on attracting foreign talent results in competition for jobs
-        Competition for jobs spurs government’s action to tighten immigration and job policy, which led to job insecurities for international undergrad
-        Implications? Potential loss of talent and reputation
-        Consequences to internation students: stress, anxiety, insecurity

Para 4: Any policies to address the precarity?
-        So far not really, take the neoliberal approach: you can stay if you earn it
-        Foreign students extensively make use of ICT (info and com tech) to navigate their precarity
