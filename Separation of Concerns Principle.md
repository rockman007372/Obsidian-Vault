## Separation of Concerns Principle

A _concern_ in this context is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.

Applying SoC **reduces functional overlaps** among code sections and also **limits the ripple effect** when changes are introduced to a specific part of the system.

This principle can be applied at class level as well as higher levels.

This principle should lead to higher cohesion and lower coupling.

## Example

- In OOP, concerns are separated into objects and classes.
- Design patterns such as [[MVC]] can separates concerns into different components
- Metaphor: separate a space into different rooms, so activities in each room are separated and do not affect those in another room.
