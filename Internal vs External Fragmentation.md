**Internal fragmentation** is typically a result of [[Fixed-size partition|fixed-size memory allocation]], where memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or pages. If a process does not perfectly fit into these fixed-size blocks, the remaining memory within the block is wasted, leading to internal fragmentation.

**External fragmentation** often occurs due to a series of allocations and deallocations of [[Dynamic partition|memory blocks of varying sizes]], leading to gaps or fragments of free memory scattered across the address space.
