## Algorithm
Based on recursion:
1. Visit every adjacent node recursively still stuck
2. Backtrack to until we find an unvisited adjacent node
3. Recurse
4. Do not repeat visited nodes

For a rooted tree: PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder are forms of DFS

**Why is the time complexity of depth first search algorithm O( V + E ) :**Â When the graph is stored in an adjacency list, the neighbors of a vertex on the out going edge are explored successively/linearly. As each vertex is explored only once, all the vertices are explored in O ( V ) time. The total number of edges (maintained in the adjacency list) are 2*E (bi-directional) for an undirected graph and E for a directed graph. Thus the time complexity is O ( 2.E + V ) for an undirected graph and O ( E + V ) for a directed graph.

## Implementations
### Recursion 
```Java
DFS(Node[] nodeList) { 
	boolean[] visited = new boolean[nodeList.length]; 
	Arrays.fill(visited, false); 
	// check every node in case there are connected components
	for (start = i; start < nodeList.length; start++) {
		if (!visited[start]) { 
			visited[start] = true; 
			DFS-visit(nodeList, visited, start); 
		}
	}
}

DFS-visit(Node[] nodeList, boolean[] visited, int startId) {
	for (Integer v : nodeList[startId].nbrList) { 
		if (!visited[v]) { 
			visited[v] = true; 
			DFS-visit(nodeList, visited, v); // recursively visit every adjacent nodes
		} 
	} 
}
```

### Stack

## Properties
1. DFS graph forms a tree
2. **NOT** a shortest path tree
3. Space: O(V + E) for Adj List, O($V^2$) for Adj Matrix
4. DFS can **detect cycles** in a directed graph (BUT [[Breadth First Search]] CANNOT)
	+ To detect a back edge, keep track of vertices **currently in the recursion stack** of function for DFS traversal. If a vertex is reached that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree.
