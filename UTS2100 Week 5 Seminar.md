# Seminar 5

## Ideas

- Machine vs Human intelligence
- Is rationality always better than emotionality? Emotions are important to decide morality
- Are there any problems that must be solved with emotions?
- How to prove that something does not feel, or feel? Someone falls down and scream, how to prove that they are in pain? If a machine produces all these reactions, how do you know they are not feeling? 
- What do you define feelings? → Philosophy of mind
	- Sensations, feelings, thoughts → You experience the world as you
	- Can we build a machine that have the same experience as we do?
- **2 mainstream conceptions:**
	- Duelism: Mind and body are 2 separate things → This is basically religion?
	- Physicalism: Your mind is a product of physical body
- Religion: Idea of the soul and spirit → Duelism
- Arugument for duelism:
	- "I think therefore I am" → Your mind is not physical, so much more different from physicality
	- How do you know if you're not dreaming → **Your reality is what you experience** 
	- How does consciousness arrive? What is consiousness even? 
- Argument for physicalism:
	- Neuroscience → Your actions are determined by neurons
	- Brain damages → Your emotions change → Your mind is a physical domain
	- What you experience is a function of physical phenomenons → Physical phenomenons are interpretted by our bodily sensors 
- How does the physicallity of the mind affect our perception of machine's intelligence?
