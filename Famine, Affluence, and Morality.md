## Main Points

- Extreme poverty still exists
- Why should we donate?
	- Thought experiement: save child in shallow pong
	- Distance makes psychological difference, but not morally relevant.
	- Distance does not reduce effectiveness of donation (modern tech)
	- Other's inaction does not excuse you inaction. You may feel less guilty but you are still morally wrong.
- How much should i donate?
	- Strong version: reduce suffering as much without sacrificing something else of **comparable moral importance** 
	- Moderate vers: reduce suffering as much without sacrificing something else of **any moral imporance**.

#### Singer's argument

Premises:

1. It is morally obligatory to save the drowning child (morally wrong otherwise)
2. There is no morally relevant differences btw saving the drowning child and helping people suffering from extreme poverty in developing country

Conclusion: Therefore, we ought to help people from extreme poverty.

## Summary

In this essay, Singer argues that individuals in affluent societies have a moral obligation to do more to alleviate suffering and poverty in the world. Here are the key points of his argument:

1. The Principle of Sacrifice:  
	- "if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it." 
	- In other words, if you can prevent something bad from happening to someone else without giving up something equally important, you have a moral duty to do so.
2. Thought experiment: The drowning kid and the shiny new shoes. Most people will choose to save the kid over preserving their new shoes.
3. The Scope of Our Moral Obligations: 
	- the geographical distance between those who suffer and those who can help should not diminish our moral responsibility. 
	- the inaction of others cannot justify our own inactions.
4. Morally right = morally obligatory.
5. The Argument for Marginal Utility:  a dollar or resource has diminishing value as one's wealth increases => giving away a portion of one's income will have a greater positive impact on the lives of the impoverished than the marginal loss of utility for the donor.
6. Counter Arguments:
	1. Charity dissolves goverment's responsibility to donate => who says if you dont donate, government will donate more?
	2. Charity to solve famine is not solution, needs population control => then donate to organization that promotes population control!
