## Intrinsic goods vs intrumental goods

- 2 kind of values: **instrumental** values and **intrinsic** values
	- Instrumentally good: good because of its effect (vacinations, money, ...)
	- Intrinsically good: good for its own sake (pleasure, happiness)
	- Instrumentally bad: smoking, drugs
	- Intrinsically bad: pain, grief
- Some things can have a lot of simultaneous values:
	- Smoking can be both instrumentally bad (cancer) and instrumentally good (pleasure, calm)
	- Pain from running: intrinsically bad (pain duh) but instrumentally good (signal that u need to stop, prevent injury)


## Wellbeing Theory

Well-being theory focuses on the study of well-being, happiness, and the factors that contribute to a fulfilling and satisfying life. It seeks to understand what makes life worth living and how individuals can lead more meaningful and flourishing lives.

>[!Definition]
>The wellbeing theory tries to explain what is **intrinsically** good.

There are 3 theories as to what is intrinsically good:

1. [[Hedonism]]
2. [[Desire Satisfaction Theory]]
3. [[Objective List Theory]]

## Summary

**instrumental and intrinsic value** are the distinction between what is a _means to an end_ and what is as an _end in itself_. 
- Things are deemed to have **instrumental value** if they help one achieve a particular end; 
- **intrinsic values**, by contrast, are understood to be desirable in and of themselves.

## Questions/Cues

- does hedonist take into account long-term pleasure? 
	- they dont care about it. they only argue that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
	- they dont claim that pleasure is the only goal, the basis of your actions.
- hedonism vs morality? Dont mix them up. One
- Is it more rational to pursue pleasure, since pleasure is the only intrinsic good. hedonist dont claim that you must?

# Tutorial 1

Exercise 1:
What is sth that is
- intrinsically good but instrumentally bad: honesty, pleasure (to encourage addiction), pursuit of perfection
- instrinsically good and instrumentally good: pleasure
- Instrinsically bad but instrumentally good:  pain (pain from workout and running)
- instrinsically bad and instrumentally bad: dishonesty
- both instrumentally good and bad: stealing (good if not caught), cheating 
- both intrinsically good and bad: ?

Exercise 2:
- Hedonist does not claim that people must plug into the experience machine because there is more pleasure to be gained.
- Hedonist claims that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
- Counter-argument?
	- We have to argue that pleasure is not the only intrinsic good.
	- The experiment does not try to disprove that people's goal is to maximize pleasure. It tries to disprove that pleasure is the only intrinsic good. 
	- The experiement claims that people may not want to plug into the machine because there are other intrinsic goods out there that they want to pursue, such as authenticity, genuine relationships, personal growth...
- they are commited to the idea that it is **rational** to do so. But seems like most people are not rational?

## Tutorial 2:

Argument:
- If hedonism is true, then life in the experience machine is better than real life
- Life in the experience machine is not better than real life according to most people
- Hence, hedonism is false.

Counter-argument:
- If you pursue sth for pleasure, you are gaining less pleasure out of it? By not fixating on pursuing pleasure, what?
- Once you are in the machine, all biases would be gone since you dont know what is reality anymore

Desire Satisfaction Theory (DST) is the view that your desires being satisfied is the only thing that’s intrinsically good for you, and your desires being frustrated is the only thing that’s intrinsically bad for you
