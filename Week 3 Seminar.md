# Week 3 Seminar

## Notes

Charles Galton Darwin: Creepy cousin obssessed with eugenics.

The g-factor: May or may not exist, but does not say anything abt nature vs nurture → Where does g come from?

Implications of nature vs nurture: social mobility → if it really is nature, we should not discover the answ?

1984, LKY, graduate marry graduate, eugenics.

Some positive values in nature: We can cater to different intelligence and recognize the differences positively → Focus on encouraging individuals to reach their fullest potentials

Do parents matter? → Also dependent on cultural factors

Indirect genetic effect → Your genetics affect how people treat you → Affect your developement → Twin experiences may not be so different after all due to their appearances

Nature and nurture **may not be indistinguishable**. They work in tandem to define who you are!
