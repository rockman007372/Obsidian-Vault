- Another schemes to represent signed numbers
- Distribute positive and negative values **evenly** accross the range of values by a translation.

Example: excess-4 representation of 3-bit numbers
- 4 negative numbers
- 3 bits → $2 ^ 3$ = 8 numbers represented → We take 4 negative and 4 non-negative
- By convention: the number of excess of an n-bit number = $2^{n - 1}$ or $2^{n - 1} - 1$
