## Usage

- Find the shortest distance between 2 nodes
- Find the shortest distance between a source and every other node
- Detect negative weight cycles

## Triangle Inequality

The algorithm is derived from the triangle inequality:

$$D(S, C) \leq D(S, A) + D(A, C)$$

## Algorithm

![[Pasted image 20220803141631.png]]

1. Initially, assign the estimates of every node to Infinity.
2. Let the estimate of the source be 0.
3. Relax every edge of the graph in random order.
4. Repeat for V - 1 iterations

```java

/** Updates the current estimate (minimum distance) of a node to the source, by making used of Triangle Inequality. */
void relax(int u, int v) {
	if (dist[v] > dist[u] + weight(u, v))
		dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v);
}

n = V.length;
for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
	for (Edge e : graph) {
		relax(e)
	}
}
```

Note: 
- We can terminate early if one iteration does not change any estimates.
- Runtime: O(EV)
- Space: O(V) to keep `estimate` array

## Why must we iterate V - 1 times?

- After 1 iteration, the node *on the shortest path* that is one hop away has the correct estimate.
- After 2 iterations, the node *on the shortest path* that is 2 hop away has the correct estimate (by building on the previous 1-hop node)
- Hence, after at most n - 1 iterations, all the nodes must have the correct estimated distance from the source.


Key property: If P is the shortest path from S to D, and X is on path P, then P is also the shortest path from S to X.

Since the correct estimate can only be found by relaxing every edge in the correct order (Breadth First Search order away from the source), we must relax for V - 1 iterations to ensure correctness.

## Special cases

- Bellman-Ford **cannot work** for negative weight edges due to **negative weight cycle** (as estimate will keep decreasing after every iteration) â†’ Bellman-Ford can detect negative weight cycle by checking if estimates still change after V iterations.
- For unweighted graphs, just use [[Breadth First Search]].
