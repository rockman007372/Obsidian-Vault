## Checklist
- [x] Finish minimax
- [x] Finish alphabeta pruning
- [x] Node [ordering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9964496/alpha-beta-move-ordering)
- [x] [timeout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66493812/implementing-iterative-deepening-with-minimax-algorithm-with-alpha-beta-pruning)
- [ ] Memoize [state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9964496/alpha-beta-move-ordering)
- [x] Data structure?
- [x] [Heuristic](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37024/Simple-AI-for-the-Game-of-Breakthrough)

You have chance to be innovative mainly in 3 areas - 
(1) the evaluation function used to evaluate the goodness of a state, 
(2) effective exploration strategy maintaining the time constraint and 
(3) modifying the alpha beta pruning algorithm for more efficient search.
