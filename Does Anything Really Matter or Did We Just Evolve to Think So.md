## Summary

- Sharon Street tries to argue why there are no mind-independent values and moral codes.
- Street claims that **knowing** the causal origins of a belief can sometimes make us either doubt or trust the belief.
	- **Hypnotism** example: Suppose you believe that the 20th US president is Rutherford Hayes but you have no idea why. Suppose then someone told you that you acquired the belief because a hypnotist implanted the belief in you through hypnosis. Clearly, knowing the causal origins of your belief about the 20th US president in this case gives you good reason to doubt the belief.
- She argues that since our moral belief or moral judgement come from evolutionary forces, it is not clear that these forces work to lead us to the mind-independent truth regarding morality (it just gives us the belief system that maximise survival and reproduction).
- Hence if there are indeed universal truths regarding morality, our confidence in our judgement is diminished after we learned about the evolutionary origin of our judgement. Hence, we should **disregard/discard** our judgements.
- However, it is intuitive that we should **not** disregard our judgement! (e.g. is a life spent screaming and doing cartwheel worth living? no by common intuition).
- Hence, it must be the case that moral truths are not mind-independent.
#### Argument

P1. Our basic evaluative tendencies are results of evolution by natural selection. 

P2. If P1 **and** we accept a mind-independent view of morality and value, we should abandon all confidence in our **value and moral** judgments. 

(why? if there are independent truths irrespective of our own judgements, and our judgements are "rigged" by evolution, why should we trust our judgement to point to the correct universal truth?)

P3. We should **not** abandon all confidence in our **value and moral** judgments. 

C. We should **not** accept a mind-independent view of morality.

#### Caveat

- If we adopt a mind-dependent view of morality, the origin of our evaluative tendencies do not matter.
	- For example, "sex feels good" is a mind-dependent fact. Even if evolution makes us evolve to like sex, we do not have to doubt the fact that sex is good. 
- Why is P2 true? 
	- Evolution is not concerned with promoting evaluative attitudes that track mind-independent truths **about morality and values**. It only promote the evaluative attitudes that maximise reproducitive success.
	- However, if we have good reasons to think that evolution helps us track certain truths to promote reproductive success, then these truths may be **vindicated** by evolution.
- ! Street is not saying ALL truths are mind-dependent (e.g. the big bang, predators, tree falling are all mind-independent facts). She claims the truths **regarding morality and values** are mind-dependent.

#### Counter arguments

The argument is valid, hence we have to attack its premises (soundness).

The most logical premise to attack is P2: it is not the case that we have to abandon our moral judgement if moral truths are mind-independent and P1 is true.
- There may be some evolutionary advantages to discovering universal truths.
- The moral judgement may come from external sources (the bible), not innate tendencies.

#### Example of mind-dependent theory of morality

>[!theory]
> A moral judgment is true = The judgment is among the moral judgments we make after rational reflection.

- Does this mean all moral values are true since it depends on what we believe?
	- "we should care about people who share our skin complexion and appearance more than others"
	- Our initial judgement may be false after rational reflection 
	- Hence, not all judgments we make are true, but there are no truths that are independent of what we judge.
