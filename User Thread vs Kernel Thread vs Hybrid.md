### Kernel Threads:

- **Managed by the Operating System**: Kernel threads are managed directly by the operating system kernel. The kernel is responsible for scheduling, managing, and executing these threads.
- **Full System Resources**: Since they are managed by the kernel, kernel threads have full access to the system's resources and can take advantage of multiple CPUs.
- **Blocking**: If a kernel thread is blocked (e.g., waiting for I/O), the OS can switch to another thread, allowing better system responsiveness.
- **Overhead**: Creating and managing kernel threads involves higher overhead due to system calls and context switching managed by the OS kernel.
- **Examples**: Threads in Java (on most platforms), POSIX threads (pthreads) on Unix-like systems.

### User Threads:

- **Managed by the User-Level Thread Library**: User threads are managed in user space, typically by a user-level thread library (e.g., POSIX pthreads in user mode, green threads).
- **No Kernel Intervention**: The kernel is unaware of user threads, so they are not scheduled by the OS. Instead, the user-level library handles their scheduling.
- **Efficiency**: User threads are lightweight with low overhead because context switching does not involve the kernel. This results in faster context switching compared to kernel threads.
- **Blocking Limitation**: If a user thread performs a blocking operation, the entire process is blocked, even if other user threads are ready to run. This is because the kernel sees the process as a single thread.
- **Portability**: User threads are more portable since they do not rely on OS-specific features.

### Hybrid Approach:

Some systems use a hybrid approach, such as the many-to-many threading model, where multiple user threads are mapped to multiple kernel threads, combining the advantages of both types.
