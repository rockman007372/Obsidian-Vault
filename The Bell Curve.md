# The Bell Curve

## Main Points
- Very controversial book in 1994 on the IQ of American society, some correlations between IQ and success rate as well social maladies, and some policy recommendations.
- The suggested policies include removal of affirmative actions, simpler tax codes, decreasing government benefits that could incentivize childbearing among the low-income, and increasing competency-based immigration screening.
- Ripped apart for presenting pseudo-science as fact and unscrupulous misinterpretation of data. Echoed conservative talking points. The science have been completely supplanted by the development of cognitive sciences and neurosciences.
- [[Howard Gardner]], the author of [[Frame of Mind]] had written to rebuke this book:
	- Scholarly Brinkmanship: "I became increasingly disturbed as I read and reread this 800 page work. I gradually realized I was encountering a style of thought previously unknown to me: **scholarly brinkmanship**. Whether concerning an issue of science, policy, or rhetoric, the authors come dangerously close to embracing the most extreme positions, yet in the end shy away from doing so. Discussing scientific work on intelligence, they never quite say that intelligence is all important and tied to one's genes; yet they signal that this is their belief and that readers ought to embrace the same conclusions. Discussing policy, they never quite say that affirmative action should be totally abandoned or that childbearing or immigration by those with low IQs should be curbed; yet they signal their sympathy for these options and intimate that readers ought to consider these possibilities. Finally, the rhetoric of the book encourages readers to identify with the IQ elite and to distance themselves from the dispossessed in what amounts to an invitation to class warfare. Scholarly brinkmanship **encourages the reader to draw the strongest conclusions, while allowing the authors to disavow this intention**"
- Some interesting criticism that Leon J. Kamin, the author of [[The Politics of IQ]] has pointed out:
	- The Bell Curve cannot tell the difference between correlation and causation. They used data to show positive correlation between IQ and economic status and thus disingenously suggests that IQ leads to the high economic status and *not vice versa*. Higher income tend to expose children of higher SES to extensive practice at reading and calculation which very directly affect IQ. Furthermore, society rewards high IQ and grant people with high IQ access to higher education, hence more opportunities to form connections and boost employability.
	- "intelligence as measured by IQ tests has been increasing dramatically over time. Thus an average contemporary youngster, taking an IQ test that had been standardized twenty years ago, would have a considerably higher than average IQ score." → Does this not show IQ can be improved through improved health, education, and childhood interventions?
