	- [[Utilitarianism]] (consequentialism) which states “the ends justify the means.”
	- [[Deontologism]] (rule-based ethics), which states that every act has to be done according to particular rules or laws. Irrespective of the outcome, these rules have to be followed, and violation is not acceptable at any time.
