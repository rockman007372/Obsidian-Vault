# The Fallacy of ‘‘Nature vs. Nurture’’

## Main Points

This is a reubuttal to [[They f you up, your mom and dad]]

### Genes
- The common belief that genes contain context-independent ‘‘information’’—and so are analogous to ‘‘blueprints’’ or ‘‘recipes’’—is simply false
- **Environmental factors are critical** in determining what protein-coding exons get read from a cistron, when, and how often. Thus, the **very concept of a gene requires the environment.** 
- Example: Mediterranean flour moth larvae with a mutation for short antennae developed normal-length antennae as adults, if raised at a higher incubation temperature than normal during a sensitive period. Their offspring for several generations retained this feature, despite the short-antennae genotype, and despite being raised at the normal incubation temperature.

### Heritability
- Heritability is defined as the *proportion of trait variation associated with corresponding genetic variation*—in a particular population under particular circumstances
- Although heritability sounds like it quantifies the degree to which a trait itself is determined by genes, it does NOT.
- Even when heritability is 100%, this does not mean genetics is the only factor that matters
	- Fingers are 100% environmental, while wearing earings is 100% genetics. No genes dictate the number of fingers you have, while biological sex determine how likely you are to wear earrings. Obviously not true and counter-intuitive
	- Even when you think you can predict intelligence using genetics, it may not be the case? 
- If analogous plant clones grow to the same height in different environments, this identical outcome cannot be concluded to be ‘‘programmed by the genes’’ in any sense: Lack of sun in one location may be matched in effect by poor soil in another, for example.
- For the purposes of heritability estimates, genes and environments can be directly controlled only for plants and some nonhuman animals, and even then, these efforts often failed.
- For humans, bombarded by rich and varied experiences every day, **many of the environmental factors cannot even be measured**, let alone controlled.
- Example: Pellagra → Malnourishment, thought ot be inheritied, turns out to be due to lack of vitamin B cause of poverty → an environmental factor unknown at the time was confounded with genetic relatedness
- Genes that contribute to skin color differences could fully ‘account for’ racial IQ differences, even if these genes influence IQ only via racist attitudes and behaviors present in our society’ → **Gene influences racist attitudes, environments lower IQ, these genes are then associatied with lower IQ.**
- Twin study and genetic determinism: Identical wins grew up separately yet shared very similar traits → Confirmation bias, as they may still be raised in very **similar enviroment and culture**. **Their similar appearance may also shape similar life experience and environment.** Lastly , they may have experienced **similar prenatal environment, which can influence genetics too.**

### Development and Evolution
- Basically, some traits may seem genetically inherited, but its more like the environment is passed down, which in turns affects genetics and behaviours. ("To the extent that we cannot help but develop in environments that are similar in important ways to the environments in which our parents developed, the **legacy we receive from our parents includes both our genes and aspects of our developmental environments**.")
- Evolutionarily speaking, both genes and critical features of environments are and must be reasonably stable across generations
- Natural selection does not act directly on genes, but on phenotypes. Phenotypes are produced and modified by both genes and environments, and behavior principles have an important role.

## Conclusion
- Moore’s book focuses on dangers of the concept of genetic determinism
- Known genetic involvement even of a single-gene single-trait type clearly does not mean that a particular outcome is unavoidable
- Such examples can still be amenable to environmental and behavioral interventions, and the monogenic ‘‘genetic’’ disease PKU is a good case in point.
- Environmental determinism is problematic too. After all, environmental interventions operate on organisms built in part by genes, and they continue to be affected by genes through gene products → EG: Down syndrome
