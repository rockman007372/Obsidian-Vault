## Main Points
**Memoization**Â is a term describing an optimization technique where you cache previously computed results, and *return the cached result when the same computation is needed again*.

Memoization is often utilized with [[Recursion]] (but it is not recursion).

Can be used to solve [[Dynamic Programming]]

Solved "**top down**" in the sense that you solve the "top" problem first (which typically recurses down to solve the sub-problems)
