I tend to put too much pressure on myself when I take exams, and though I usually do well, I've learned some coping strategies over the years.

1.  **Make study conditions like exam conditions**. At my university, I can generally access at least two practice tests. I use one of them as a diagnostic shortly after I begin my exam review (i.e., reading notes and doing homework problems) to see where I should focus after I've remembered all the key concepts, and another as a check-in a day or two before the test to see how far I've come and where I still need to work. This serves two purposes: First, it gives me practice with the material. After I take the exam in an "exam-like" environment, I make sure I thoroughly understand the solution to every question. Second, it gives me practice for the test. If I simulate an exam environment, dealing with an actual exam isn't so bad. If you can't find an exam, you can use questions you write, a TA writes, or that you find in your homework or notes. When possible, I make old exams the basis of my studying.
    
2.  **Use good test-taking strategies**. This means reading over the test as soon as you get it and starting by answering the highest value questions you're the most likely to get right. Don't be afraid to skip something and come back to it. You'll feel better by knocking out some easy stuff early, and thus having a point base to calm you down as you try to solve tricky questions. Plus, you might remember an answer or solution strategy if you have some time to reflect on a question you can't immediately answer.
    
3.  **Breathe**. I'm high-strung. I freak out during exams when I can't remember the material. Freaking out, as your question suggests, will never help you do well. As soon as I feel myself getting anxious, I put my pencil down, close my eyes, and practice "square breathing." I inhale for four seconds, hold my breath for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, hold my breath for four more seconds, and then repeat. You can vary the times to suit your lung capacity. I'm usually ready to start answering questions after going through this exercise twice.
    
4.  **Make relaxation a priority**. This falls into two big categories for me. First, I try to clear my head before I take an exam. I usually walk to my tests, and I never study within an hour of an exam. I know I'm prepared before that, and that reduces my anxiety. Second, I watch my caffeine intake on exam days. Caffeine makes you anxious, and the boost it provides isn't energy I can usually put to good use during exams.
    
5.  **Consider seeking medical help**. If you find yourself cripplingly anxious before exams, you might want to speak with a mental health professional. You might benefit from low levels of medication, and at the very least, a medical health professional can give you other strategies to help you manage your exam anxiety.
    

Exams are scary. Remember, **your grade isn't a reflection of who you are**; it's just a noisy sample of how well you know the material for one class that likely won't matter in a year.
