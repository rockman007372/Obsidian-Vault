# Network Protocols

### Main Points

- Internet supports many network applications
- When applications exchange messages and communicate among peers, they must follow some **protocols**
- Protocol defines *format* and *order* of messages exchanged and actions taken after messages are sent or received
- The Internet Protocol *Stack* are logically organized into **5 layers**:
		- [[Application Layer]]
		- [[Transport Layer]]
		- Network
		- Link
		- Physical
- At source, you push onto the stack these protocol layers, and when packet is transmitted to dest, the layers are popped from stack.
