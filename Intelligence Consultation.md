## Notes

Our module is divided into 4 themes:

#### What is intelligence
##### [[Week 1 Seminar]]
What is intelligence defined as? 
- Adaptability to new knowledge? How fast one learns
- Knowledge and mastery in a certain field?
- Or potential to excel

Personally, I never actively try to pinpoint what intelligence is. I simply intuitively know who around me are more intelligent - they can understand concepts and pick up things fast, they quickly present good solutions to a problem, they can do quick maths, or they are eloquent and logical.  In a sense, intelligence to me has a lot to do with logics. 

##### [[Week 2 Seminar]]
We explore what is the IQ and its flaws.
We also explore PISA and how the test 

##### [[Week 3 Seminar]]
The existence of a g-factor.
Nurture vs Nature assumption.


#### How to measure intelligence
Through our expo research. 

#### Artificial intelligence and intelligence in technology

##### [[UTS2100 Week 5 Seminar]]

Mainstream conceptions about consciousness: duelism vs physicalism → determined whether AI is sentient

The idea of superintelligence. Debate how neccessary are AI and whether its all doom for humanity (can superintelligent AI  can be controlled)

##### [[Week 8 Seminar]]
What technology (e.g. drugs, dieting, genetic engineering, surgery, implants) can or has been used make us more intelligent? Which of these is ethical to use and why? How does the recent history of enhancement change how we conceive intelligence in Singapore?


#### Intelligence in Singapore
