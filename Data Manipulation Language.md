## Overview
DML commands are used to **manipulate the data stored in the database**. This includes retrieving data using SELECT, inserting new data using INSERT, modifying data using UPDATE, and deleting data using DELETE. DML commands are used to interact with the actual data stored in the database, rather than the structure of the database itself.
