[[The Challenge of Cultural Relativism]]

## Validity and Soundness of an argument

An argument = premises + a conclusion.

Deduction argument: premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion => we focus on deduction argument only.

How to evaluate an argument?
1. The premises are true
2. The premises, if true, guarantee the truth of the conclusion

Validity: If premises are true, conclusion must be true. (if premises are false, vacuously true)

Soundness: Validity + premises are true.

> Valid: p1 ^ p2 ^ ... -> q
> Sound: p1 ^ p2 ^ ... -> q and (p1 ^ p2 ^ ...) = TRUE

## Cultural relativism
- Moral truths are relative to a culture or society.
- There is no such thing as universal truths in ethics/morality.
- This does not mean we cannot criticize other society (there is no objective rule forbidding that)
- This does not say anything about whether the moral truths are mind-dependent or mind-independent => A moral truth be mind-independent and not universal? (e.g. there are many truths, and different societies just happen to follow different truths)
