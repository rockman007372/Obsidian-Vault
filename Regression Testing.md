When you modify a system, the modification may result in some unintended and undesirable effects on the system. Such an effect is called a _regression_.

**_Regression testing_ is the re-testing of the software to detect regressions.** Note that to detect regressions, you need to retest all related components, even if they had been tested before.

Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, **regression testing is more practical when it is automated** (See also: [[Automating the Build Process]]).
