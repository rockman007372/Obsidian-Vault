Client-side scripting is a type of programming that takes place on the client-side, or the user's web browser, rather than on the server. Client-side scripting is typically used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing users to interact with the page and make changes without having to reload the entire page.

Examples of client-side scripting technologies include [[JavaScript]], [[jQuery]], and AngularJS. These scripting languages can be used to manipulate the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) of a web page, which represents the HTML and XML elements of the page, allowing developers to add and remove elements, change the content of elements, and apply styles and animations to elements. Client-side scripting can also be used to handle user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and key presses.

One of the **main benefits** of client-side scripting is that **it can improve the user experience by providing faster and more responsive interactions**. Because client-side scripting is *executed on the user's browser*, it can respond to user actions quickly and *without the need to communicate with the server*, reducing the amount of time needed to load new content.
