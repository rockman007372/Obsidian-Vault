**Process:**

- A process is a standalone program that is in execution. It has its own memory space, resources, and system state.
- Each process runs independently and is isolated from other processes. This isolation provides protection and security because one process cannot directly access the memory or resources of another process.
- Processes communicate with each other using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, like pipes, sockets, or shared memory.
- Starting a new process is generally more resource-intensive compared to starting a new thread.

**Thread:**

- A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, and these threads share the same resources and memory space.
- Threads within the same process can communicate more easily since they share the same memory and resources. 
- Threads are faster to create and terminate compared to processes since they share resources.
