Â This is a computer architecture used in most modern computers and is based on the **stored-program concept, where instructions and data are stored in the same memory unit**.


RAM ([[Random Access Memory]]) is the memory where programmes and variables are stored.

von Neumann describes the computer consisting of 3 components:
- Central Procressing Unit (CPU)
	- Registers (General Purpose Registers, GPR)
	- A control unit containing an instruction register and program counter (PC)
	- An arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)
- Memory
	- Stores both program and data in [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]
- I/O devices (Input/Output)
