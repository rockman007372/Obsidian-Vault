Add more reflection:

In terms of your group reflection, you can have it here, but remember to also include reflections on earlier processes. E.g. reflection on your use of theory (contradictions, less is more, etc.), reflection on site survey, form, setup (what you missed, what you would have done differently), etc. If you want to reflect at each section (as you go along), that is possible too. Currently, however, I don't see much reflection coming through.

However, we identified some limitations in our project. Firstly, the draw from the project seemed not strong enough to stop commuters if the commuters are in a rush. Most interviewees agreed if they had to hurry somewhere, or had some urgent task at hand, they would not slow down and engage with the installation. This would explain why more people engaged with the installation at night time, when there are no more classes to rush for or less work to attend to. This allowed them the piece of mind to stop and detach themselves for a moment under the umbrella.

Secondly, the project catered more to those with an appreciation for the arts. The majority of audience who responded well to the project and took a pause were artistically experienced, or enjoyed arts and music. This is understandable because Fermenta relied heavily on the appeal of the art (through the use of fairy light to improve aesthetics and music to engage the senses) to attract and slow down commuters. Hence, it may not be as effective in slowing down those who have less appreciation for the arts.

The data also suggests that groups are more likely to slow down and interact with our project. On any given day, the percentage of people slowing down given they are in a group is significantly higher than individuals. 

There could be several reasons for this behaviour. One possibility is that being in a group creates a social dynamic that encourages interaction with the environment.
People in groups might feel more comfortable exploring and engaging with their surroundings, particularly if they were with friends. Meanwhile, individuals felt more vulnerable to judgement when they stopped in the middle of a busy transitory space. Furthermore, group interaction with the installation may also be influenced by social norms and peer pressure, as individuals may feel more compelled to participate if others in their group are doing so. Hence, this suggests that Fermenta could have done more to engage with individual commuters.



We were initially concerned that commuters were pausing only to take pictures of the new installation, without meaningfully disengaging from their busy routines. However


## Personal Reflection on learning journey throughout the project (600 words!) - more critical, less descriptive? What, so what, now what

I appreciated the chance to work 

Overall, enjoyed the process of ideating and setting up an intervention project. 

Inspired by the videos and creative project showed in class. But found it difficult to generate a good creative idea that linked to model city. 

Link to a lot of concepts, but could not tie them together (solve a design gap, slow down people, )=> less is more. Focus on one primary objective: a placemaking device to help people pause

Marcus designing skills, Faith strong writing ability. Learned from Faith's writing rigour and high standard of documentation. Impressed by Marcus's creativity and artistic visions

Hope I could be more useful?  I tried my best to analyse result and statistic, make data collection for systematic. My strength did not really shine through, but it was rather difficult. 

Pleasantly surprised and happy at the good reception.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process of the intervention project. Through the project, I consolidated the knowledge I acquired from UTC2105, and learned some valuable insights about myself. 

When I first saw the videos and examples of past intervention projects in class, I **was very intrigued** by the creativity and ingenuinity in their link to Singapore as a Model City. I **felt inspired and wanted to craft a meaningful intervention project** that would be both innovative and related to the module content. However, **coming up with an idea proved difficult to me**, because I could not settle on which theme to focus on among the many ones explored in our module. My groupmates also leaned towards interventions that are more artistic in nature, **which admittedly is not my strength**. 

In the end, our group identified the design flaw that was the lack of shelter at the pathway between ERC and Tembusu, and wanted to address this through the intervention. However, I struggled to tie our project back to the concepts taught in Model city. Therefore, **I had to actively review the concepts I had learned to make conceptual connections to our intervention**. I identified that Fermata matched the definition of a place-making device, as it served to improve the quality and functionality of the pathway by sheltering commuters from the elements, and inviting them to take a break. I also found our use of lights and musics to resemble a form of play topologies, in particular play as Simulation. For instance, Fermata activated the visual and auditory senses of passers-by in hopes of disengaging them from their busy pace of life, similar to how simulation "involves forgetting, disguising or otherwise escaping one's usual self and one's place in the world" (Stevens, 2007). It was an insightful moment for me that the concepts taught in class can actually be connected to, and applied in the intervention project. Hence, I am thankful that the project allowed me to consolidate the knowledge I learned in a meaningful and practical way.

I also learned a lot from working with my talented and competent teammates. Faith has strong writing ability and high attention to details, hence she was very effective and efficient at ensuring our documentation was up to high standard. I was also very impressed by Marcus's rich creativity, artistic visions and competent design skills. He came up with brilliant ideas (such as choosing the name Fermata for our project) and designed all the graphics for the installation. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with them, because the skills they possess are areas I still have much to grow in.

I also regret that my strengths as a Computer Science student did not sufficiently shine through in the project, and wish I could have contributed more meaningfully to it. While I did try my best to handle data collection and analyse the results and statistics in a rigorous and systematic manner, I felt the project would still be as successful were I to be replaced by another student.
