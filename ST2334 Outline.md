# ST2334 Outline
  
### Lecture Slides
- The lecture notes will be posted under "Files/Lecture Notes". The notes for Chapter 1 has been posted. There are three files, they are:
	- (1) "ST2334_Chapter_1_Video_Slides.pdf": it contains slides that are to be used for pre-recorded videos (slides are printed in black).   
	- (2) "ST2334_Chapter_1_Slides.pdf": it contains slides for both pre-recorded videos (printed in black) and those for our lecture meetings (printed in blue). So "(1)" is a subset of "(2)".   
	- (3) "ST2334_Chapter_1_for_Print.pdf": it is of exactly the same contents as "(2)" but better to be printed as hard copies (for people who like hard copies).
