> A superkey is a subset of attributes that **uniquely** identifies a tuple in a relation

Example: 
- {student_id, name} is a superkey. It can be used to identify a student in a university. 
- However, *it is not mininal*, as {student_id} alone can already uniquely identify a student. {student_id} is considered a [[Key]]
