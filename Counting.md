# Counting

### Main Points

- 2 fundamental principles in counting:
	- Multiplication principle
	- Addition principle

- **Multiplication** principle: 
	- For experiments *performed sequentially*

- **Addition** principle: 
	- Suppose that an experiment can be performed by k different procedures
	- Suppose the ways under different procedures **do not overlap**
	- The total numbers of ways that we can perform the experiments is $$n_{1}+ n_{2}+...+n_{k}$$
