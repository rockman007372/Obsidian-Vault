## Overview

An *application programming interface* (API) is a particular set of **rules ('code') and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other**. 

It serves as an interface between different software programs and facilitates their interaction, similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers.

In layman's term: An API is the interface through which you access someone elses code or through which someone else's code accesses yours. 


> [!Example]  
> A class has an API (e.g., [API of the Java String class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)) which is a collection of public methods that you can invoke to make use of the class.

## When is it used

Example: Weather application

**Without API** - Weather application must open weather.com site and read the details as a human does.

**With API** - Weather application will send a message to weather.com and receive the result and then display it.
