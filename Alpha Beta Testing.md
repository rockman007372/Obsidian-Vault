_Alpha testing_ is performed by the **users, under controlled conditions** set by the software development team.

_Beta testing_ is performed by a selected **subset of target users** of the system in their **natural work setting** (not controlled).

An _open beta release_ is the release of not-yet-production-quality-but-almost-there software to the general population. For example, Google’s Gmail was in 'beta' for many years before the label was finally removed.
