## Overview

An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). 

An IDE generally consists of

-   **A source code editor** that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.
-   A **compiler and/or an interpreter** (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.
-   A **debugger** that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.
-   **Other tools** that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.
