- Give out "lottery tickets" to processes for resources (cpu time, i/o device)
- When a scheduling decision is needed, a lottery ticket is chosen randomly among eligible tickets => winner takes resource
- In the long run, a process can hold X% of the total ticket. Hence they can use the resource X% of the time.
- Goods:
	- Responsive: new process can immediate participate in lottery
	- Good level of control of process's resource usage:
		- important processes given more tickets
		- process can distribute tickets to child process
		- each resource has its own set of tickets, hence different proportion of resource usage
	- Simple to implement
