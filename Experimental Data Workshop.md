# Experimental Data Workshop

## Questions/Cues

## Notes

What makes an experiment good?
- Researching confounders
- Correlation vs Relationship vs Causation
- Engaging → Result can be better 
- Attention in relation to intelligence! → People of certain intelligence may stay engaged more in similar task → Flow state

Common mistake: Collect data first then analyse? 
→ You should plan analysis before running the experiment? You need a hypothesis first, then we test the hypothesis using the emperiment data

Example research question: What factors cause people to survive or perish in the Titanic 
- Social status
- Being a women, children, elderly
- Locations

Use a PIVOT TABLE to analyse data and find correlations! → Google!

How to use qualitative data analysis:
- Break down the important touchpoints? Breakdown?
- Keywords
- Similiarity or contrast 
- *Coding method* ?
- Make connections between qualitative vs quantitative

Testimonial data:
- What are the limitations of testimonial data: Bias, recalling issues
	- Eg: Only those who survived were able to provide testimony
	- Someone who did sth controversial may not admit
