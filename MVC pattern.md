## Context

Most applications support:
1. storage/retrieval of information, 
2. displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and 
3. changing stored information based on external inputs.

## Problem

High coupling.

## Solution

Decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: _Model_, _View_ and _Controller_.
