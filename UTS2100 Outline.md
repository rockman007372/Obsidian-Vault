### What is this Seminar about?

This module is an interdisciplinary seminar investigating the concept of ‘intelligence’ in relation to Singapore’s ongoing development as a nation. The idea that smart minds are essential for survival has shaped domestic policies and the brand that Singapore projects, as well as how she positions herself internationally. We ask:

-   In what ways has human intelligence been defined, measured and harnessed?
-   What is counted as intelligence, and what is not?
-   To what extent is intelligence understood as being acquired or as innate?

Beyond notions of intelligence centered on the human individual, we will also consider forms of collective and artificial intelligence, mediated by science and technology. What kinds of intelligence are needed for the future and how can Singapore develop them?

### What will we learn in this Seminar?

This module centres on the following foci for learning, although these may not be the only things you learn:

1.  Identifying different ways of conceptualizing or categorizing intelligence across disciplines and in history;
2.  Appraising the concept of intelligence in light of evolving relations between humans and technology;
3.  Examining how certain tests and policies (relating to individual, collective or state intelligence) conceptualize intelligence and what they assume about intelligence;
4.  Collecting, analyzing, and deriving scientific insights from qualitative and quantitative primary research data;
5.  Formulating a policy proposal based on primary and secondary research, that recognizes its own values and displays awareness of espoused notions of intelligence in twenty-first century Singapore.

You will also learn to discuss different ways of understanding intelligence and to write clearly about applications of the understandings of the intelligence relevant to the Singapore context.  

### How will we be assessed in this Seminar?

As with all Senior Seminars, this is a graded module that can be converted to Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) if you wish to do so and have not yet exceeded your S/U option entitlement. The S/U declaration exercise is conducted upon the release of examination results and will end by a stipulated deadline, which will be announced each semester.

How much you get from the module depends on how much you put in. The assessment for the module is overviewed at [Assignments](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/24874/assignments "Intelligence Discussion Paper (Week 8)") and described in detail in the [Assignment Guide page](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/24874/pages/assignment-guide "Assignment Guide"). During the semester, you will hand in your assignments according to the deadlines and receive feedback on the quality of your work.

### What are the key policies that I need to know?

**As this is a seminar-style class, regular attendance is expected**. *Unaccounted absences will be reflected in a deduction from your overall grade*: a deduction of two percentage points for one absence, five percentage points for two absences and ten percentage points for three absences. Thus a maximum of 10% points can be deducted for failing to attend seminars.

Absences will be excused if you have a valid reason, such as illness or some forms of official university-related business. In both cases, *documentation is normally required*. Note that College-related events and mid-term examinations for other modules are not considered a valid reason for missing a seminar. In any given case, unless this is not possible due to an emergency situation, you should contact your lecturer well in advance to determine whether or not you can be formally excused.

Arriving to class on time is also important. *If you arrive more than 15 minutes late, you will be considered absent for the day*. If you have a regular conflict that prevents you from coming to class in a timely manner, please schedule a meeting with your lecturer to discuss how it might be resolved.

If you have missed a seminar, whatever the reason is, please note that it is your responsibility to find out what was discussed, and, by doing so, ensure that you are able to participate fully in subsequent seminars.

**Given this is a seminar-style module, grades are awarded for your participation in seminars: Seminar Participation**. In the first seminar, your lecturer will discuss what Seminar Participation is and how it will be graded.

**Be aware of the plagiarism policy and the high standards that ensure that we learn from other people's ideas without copying them**. *You should always acknowledge all your sources – including Internet sources and your own and other students’ previously submitted work – with proper citations, and ensure that you use quotation marks if you incorporate literal quotes in your text*. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the Note on Plagiarism Prevention on the WoodieCentral intranet, and to consult with the fellow teaching you in case you have further questions.

**Certain minimum standards of behaviour are necessary** for this to function as a Tembusu seminar-style class: both in the seminar itself and in any references to it before or afterwards in digital or social media. 

**Deadlines are strict**. If and when you can't submit on time, please be proactive in communicating, and in finding a reasonable solution. You should make contact to explain why this is so, and ask for an individual extension. The length of the extension is up to the lecturer's discretion. *If the request is made in reasonable time before the deadline with good reason* (as judged by the lecturer), the submitted work will not be subject to any penalty, providing the renegotiated deadline is met. If the request is not made in reasonable time, there will be a grade penalty, providing the renegotiated deadline is met. If you make the request after the deadline has already passed, there will be a higher grade penalty, provided you make contact within 24 hours of the deadline passing, and that a renegotiated deadline is then swiftly set and met.

If you have not requested an extension before the deadline, and *assignments are received within a reasonable time after the deadline,* your lecturer has the discretion to waive off any penalty or deduct marks from the assignment grade.

Assignments received after any re-negotiated deadline will not be graded. Not communicating will also result in a late assignment not being graded. Your best bet, then, is to submit on time, or if you really can’t, request an extension as early as possible, then do everything in your power to meet the new deadline.

This policy does not include deadline extensions that apply to the entire class, which are free from any penalties, and are considered new ‘first’ deadlines.

### Guest Experts

The module will draw on a number of guest experts. We will attempt to conduct at least some guest expert talks during seminar time.
