**A _platform_ provides a runtime environment for applications.** A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies, but the defining characteristic is the presence of a runtime environment to run code.

Example: JavaEE (runtime is JVM - Java Virtual Machine) and .NET (runtime is CLR - Common Language Runtime).
