1. The game is about having fun. remember that. all added pressure is unnecessary.
 
2. Get a good nights rest before game day. Lack of sleep can cause an increase in cortisol which is your main stress hormone. & this may effect nerves

3. Get better at, at least one thing everyday. Even if it’s only 10 minutes a day, this preparation will lead to feeling confident in your ability’s

4. Meditate daily for 15 minutes. Find a quiet comfy space, and through that 15 mins think about nothing but how much you love basketball. Or VISUALIZE yourself succeeding in games. Whether it’s making a shot and the crowd cheers, or running your plays right and your coach is happy, be as detailed as possible.

5. if you are ever feeling overwhelmed before a game, practice counting backwards from 10 and recenter yourself to the present.

6. If you’re extremely nervous before a game, use nose breathing to tap into relaxation. Breathe in through your nose 5 seconds and out for 10.

7. the BEST players make mistakes. Basketball is a game of imperfection. Don’t shutdown out of fear. Embrace that it will happen and play through it
