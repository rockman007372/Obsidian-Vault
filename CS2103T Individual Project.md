## Goal

### 2023-01-20 Friday
- [x] Rename bot
- [x] Implement Operation ENUM
	- [x] Create switch statement for each CONSTANT

### 2023-01-26 Thursday
- [x] Save the tasks in the hard disk automatically whenever the task list changes
	- [x] addTask
	- [x] markTask
	- [x] unmarkTask
	- [x] deleteTask
	- [x] Handle the case where data file doesnt exist at the start
- [x] Load the data from the hard disk when Duke starts up

### 2023-02-16 Thursday
- [x]   Tweak the GUI to match the asymmetric nature of the conversation: As the conversation is between the user and the app (not between two humans), it is asymmetric in nature. Accordingly, it makes sense not to display both sides of the conversion in the same visual format.
- [x] Make button more interactive
- [x]   Highlight errors e.g., when the user types a wrong command, the error should be shown in a different format to catch ther user's attention.
- [x]   Tweak padding, fonts, colors, alignments to make the GUI more pleasing to look at.  Given the app is likely to take only a small portion of the screen, and the bot replies can contain lot of text, try to optimize for space (e.g., avoid wasting display space that simply shows the background graphics).
- [x]   Allow resizing of the Window, and ensure the content resize appropriately as the Window changes size.
- [x] Profile pictures: If your GUI shows profile pictures, you can tweak the way the picture is shown (e.g., crop as a circle or a square with rounded corners). In fact, an easy tweak is to use a picture with a transparent background so that it blends nicely with the background.  Given that the participants of the conversion are fixed (i.e., you and the chatbot), do you even need big profile pictures?
- [x]   Focus more on tweaks that actually _improves_ the user experience (UX). Some changes (e.g., profile pictures, background graphics) can be eye catching but can even degrade the UX if not done right (e.g., it can make the text harder to read)
