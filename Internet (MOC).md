## Questions

Q1. Difference between bandwidth and latency?
- Latency is the time taken to travel end to end - basically delay
- Bandwidth is the total amount of data travelled in one second from end to end â†’ Transmission rate / link bandwidth
- Latency says nothing about of bandwidth. You can travel very fast from A to B, but if the bandwidth is low, bits are not transmitted into link fast enough.
