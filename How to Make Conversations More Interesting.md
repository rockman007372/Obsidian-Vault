## Main Points

- The best conversationalists know how to deftly maneuver the multiple threads of a conversation to lead from the beginning to a specific destination
- Don’t be afraid to chase threads of interesting conversation when talking with your prospects
- Some tips to keep the convo interesting:

### 1. Keep the conversation focused on the other person
- This does not mean you should stay quiet the whole time. 
- Ask the right questions, make anecdotes of your own too. Be in control of the conversation.

### 2. Find point of commonality and connection
- There will be points of common interests that naturally surface during the conversation. When they do, take the opportunity to connect over them.

### 3. Watch Late-Night Talk Shows

Naturally, talk-show hosts ask a lot of questions, mix in humor, and keep the conversation mostly focused on the other person along the interaction. You can also watch serious programs with hard-hitting interviews if that’s more your style.

### 4. Talk Slowly and Enunciate

Make sure you purposefully slow your cadence down to the point where it feels almost too slow for you. I promise, you won’t be talking too slow if you do—it only feels that way. This is something you can practice by recording yourself or asking a friend to listen to you and give feedback.

The second major point is to enunciate your words. Get your mouth muscles used to pronouncing complex words with vocal warmups like:

-   Red leather, yellow leather (three times in a row)
-   You know New York, you need New York, you know you need unique New York
-   Betty Botter bought a bit of bitter butter, but the bit of butter was too bitter for the batter, so Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter

All this will help you **talk clearly, calmly, and confidently**. That’s what people want to hear and it’ll draw them more into the conversation.

### 5. Focus on the Conversation

Remember: you want to be genuine and authentic in your conversations. How can you do that if you don’t pay attention?

### 6. Ask Personal Questions

Take the opportunity at the beginning of a conversation to learn about the people you’re speaking with by asking questions about them. Focus on them by including the word “you” in your questions.

### 7. Ask Open-Ended Questions

If someone can answer your question with a simple “Yes” or “No,” you’re doing it wrong. These types of questions can **immediately shut the conversation down**.

### 8. Handle Controversial Topics Delicately

Typically, there are three things people don’t like to talk about: personal finance, politics, and religion.

>Head out into the real world and talk with people, try asking new questions to your friends, and work on your active listening skills.
>The more you talk, the better your conversation skills will become. That, in turn, can drastically help improve your ability to snare someone’s attention on a cold call, nail your demo presentation, and maintain lasting relationships with a prospect that leads to a signed deal.
