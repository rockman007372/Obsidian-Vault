## Notes
Are we morally obligated to enhance intelligence? Is the genetic lottery unfair?

The consequence of equalizing the playing field: How to differentiate talent? Employment competition? Structural changes from enhancing intelligence? 

Are grades fair? Is effort proportional to grade? Why do intelligent people deserve better grades without putting in as much effort?

Inequality and unfairness are neccessary? Hmm
