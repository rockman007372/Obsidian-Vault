## Things to take note

#### Assignment 4: CC
- Strategies to prove if a local xact is produced by some protocol: for each xact, check if it commits, yet get executed again.
	- S2PL:  A transaction must commit before any other transaction reads/updates the same object it is dealing with.
	- SI: concurrent xacts cannot update the same objects => check writes on same object
- Algo to find serializable global schedule: find the write W(o), then check left and right to see any read/write on o by other xact.

#### Lecture 8: Data replication
- In eager centralized protocol: write to master site first, then write to coordinating site, then coordinating site send writes to other sites
- In lazy centralized protocol: write to master site first, then once coordinating site sends commit to master, master sends refresh xact (writes) to all other sites
- Eager protocol always ensure 1-copy serializability, but lazy protocol does not.
