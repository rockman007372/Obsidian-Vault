##### Definition
The probability function is defined to quantify the probability that X is **in a certain range**

**Properties:**

To check is a function f(x) is a p.d.f, we just have to **check (1) and (2).**

For any x $\in R_x$, we must have $P(X = x) = 0$:

##### Example
- Given a formula for $f(x)$, you must use [[Integration]] to:
	- Find constant c so $f(x)$ is a probability distribution function
	- Prove that $f(x)$ is a probability distribution function
	- Find $P(a \leq X \leq b)$ or $P(X \in A)$
