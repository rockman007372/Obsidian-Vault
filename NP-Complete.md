NP-Complete problems are the hardest problem in [[NP]]. This means
- every other problem in NP is at most as hard as NP complete problems.
- every problem in NP can be reduced to NP-complete problems.

Strategy to prove Y is NP-complete:
1. Show that Y is in NP
2. Choose an NP-complete problem X
3. Prove that $X \leq_{p}Y$

These problems below are all NP-Complete and reduce to each other:
