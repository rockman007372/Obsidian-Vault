# To see G or not to see G

## Main Points
- Should we refer to intell as one intell or many intels? This study is to measure whether different skills measured in IQ tests are related to each other or largely distinct.
- Question I want to address here is: do people tend to be good at some tests and poor at others, or are people just generally good or bad at mental tests?

- The tests are tapping quite a wide range of our mental functions: seeing similarities and differences, drawing inferences, working out and applying rules, remembering and manipulating mental material, working out how to construct shapes, processing information at speed, articulating the meaning of words, recalling general knowledge, explaining practical actions in everyday life, working with numbers, attending to details, and so forth.
- The fact is that every single one of those 13 tests in the WAIS-III has a **positive correlation with every other one**. People who are better at any one test tend to be better at all of the others. 
- Sub-groups of tests in the WAIS-III collection associate higher among themselves than with others â†’ although they relate quite strongly to every test in the WAIS-III collection, they **form a little pool of tests that are especially highly related among themselves.**
- When correlation is measured between subgroups, it is still significant! People who tend to be skilled in one group factors tend to be skilled in all others as well.

## Conclusion
- There seem to be some correlation between different subgroups of intelligence, and the existence of a g-factor
- This is basically a **rebuttal of Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence** ([[Frame of Mind]])
- Rebuttal from Gardner: these correlation tests are heavily skewed towards conventional intelligence (logical and linguistic)
- IQ tests do not measure creativity or wisdom. Neither of these is easy to measure, though both have some demonstrable associations with intelligence. 
- Mental ability tests do not measure personality, social adroitness, leadership, charisma, cool-headedness, altruism, or many other things that we value.
