- Map logical page to a physical frame.
- Need to look up this mapping scheme in the Page Table.
- The physical memory is split into equal-sized *frames*.
- The memory of the process is also logicall splitted into *pages* of the same size as the frame.
- The pages are contiguous in logical space, but completely disjoint in frame space.
