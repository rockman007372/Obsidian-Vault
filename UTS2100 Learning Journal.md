### Reflection on construction and participation in intelligence test

My intelligence test tries to measure spatial intelligence. The reason is because these intelligence classifications are often overlooked in conventional IQ tests which primarily focus on measuring linguistic and logical abilities.

For the spatial intelligence test, I prepare a set of grids of increasingly bigger dimensions (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, ...), and mark out some entries in each grid to create a random pattern. The participants are then required to replicate the patterns on empty grids of the same size, once the patterned grids have been removed.  I believe those with higher spatial intelligence should excel at this test. This is because they are capable of deriving more insights and connections from these visual data, which allows these patterns to be more easily ingrained in their memory. From my research, chess and Rubik's cube players tend to perform excellently in these kinds of tests, because their respective games involve  a great deal of making sense of arbitrary patterns and memorizing them.

I only managed to test 2 people using my tests. One got everything right until the 8x8 grid while the other failed at 6x6. When asked about their strategies to memorize the grid, the player who did worse relatively mentioned they tried to  memorize where the marked entries in the grid were. Meanwhile, the person who performed better explained that they were trying to visualize the pattern as a whole and link it to an image or object resembling the pattern. This is evidence that there are certain memorizing techniques that can boost one's performance in such memory-intensive tests. Hence, such tests may not be accurate measurement of innate spatial intelligence and short-term memory, as memorization abilities can certainly improve with practice and proper techniques.

I also took two tests, and they were both very memorable. One test attempted to measure humor intelligence by making me produce a funny anecdote based on some information about a target audience whom I am required to entertain. The other test measured my linguistic and teaching abilities by requiring me to guess the meaning of some abstract vocabularies based on their structure (prefixes and suffixes) and explain my thought process. Both are quite unconventional intelligence tests that I have not encountered before, and I had a genuinely fun time participating in them. However, the humor test could get a bit stressful given the pressure to make the other party laugh, and I personally think it may not a good measurement of one’s ability to produce humor. I believe humor comes in many different forms and producing humor using anecdotes only conveys good verbal and linguistic abilities, which is one among many skills that can generate humor.

### Reflection on Intelligence measurement in Singapore

I am not a Singaporean, but an international student from Vietnam on a government scholarship. I will first reflect on the scholarship selection test I took 5 years ago to derive some insights into what types of intelligence the Singapore government values in scholars. I will also use my experience with the O level examination in Singapore to show the assumptions Singapore education system makes about intelligence, and how I think it impacts the future opportunities for Singaporean students.

The scholarship selection test I took was comprised of 3 parts. Firstly, it used a very conventional IQ test to measure our logical and spatial intelligence. We then had to take a slightly advanced secondary-level math paper, followed by an English paper consisting of reading comprehension and creative writing sections.  It is obvious that Singapore places much significance to logical, spatial, and linguistic intelligence when it comes to recruiting scholars. Here are my proposed reasons why Singapore looks out for these specific qualities when giving out scholarships. Firstly , previous scholarship recipients who possess these forms of intelligence had a proven track record of thriving under the Singapore education system. It can thus be deduced that the Singapore education system favors these aspects of intelligence. Secondly, it is no secret that Singapore spent a sizable portion of their budget on these generous scholarships for the main purpose of attracting "foreign talents" to Singapore. Talents who are competent in technical roles such as software developers, engineers and doctors typically possess these forms of intelligence.  Therefore, Singapore hopes to bring in students excelling at such intelligence to train them into competent workers who can make significant contributions to the economy.  In short, certain forms of intelligence are criteria for Singapore to select scholars because these scholars have a higher chance of becoming valuable workers for the Singapore workforce.

Since I arrived in Singapore in Sec 3, I have gone through 2 national exams, the O level and A level. Personally, I believe the students' performance in these momentous exams is Singapore's primary benchmark for intelligence. I will focus on the O level exam for my analysis. I believe the O level is testament to Singapore's belief in a centralized, general intelligence. This is because to score well in O Level, you are required to be proficient in a wide range of subjects, from mathematics to art and humanities. No matter how good you are at a certain subject, your aggregate score can still be dragged down by other unrelated subjects. In my opinion, Singapore education assumes that intelligence is the ability to absorb and master knowledge of any given fields at a faster rate. Hence, an intelligent person in Singapore's standard is expected to be able to excel in many different domains at once. This assumption is frankly incorrect in my opinion. There are many reasons why a student may not excel in O Level, while still being intelligent in other ways. Firstly, some students can simply have greater interest in a specific subject over other subjects, and hence divert more time and effort to their preferred domains. Secondly, some students from lower income groups may have to work part-time to support their family, which spares them little time to study so many different subjects at once. Lastly, some are just naturally inept at certain subjects, yet can still have an aptitude for other ones. These scenarios are not accounted for in the O level score, yet Singapore still uses it as a benchmark for intelligence. Worse still, it is also the deciding factor for post-secondary education pathways. Due to Singapore's narrow definition of intelligence, not everyone has access to quality education resources just because they lack the ability to excel in everything.
