| Title                | Review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Half Life Black Mesa | Game is really atmospheric and immersive, I felt really absorbed and involved in the world of HL. However, Xen, as incredibly beautiful as it is, was too competitive gameplay-wise and I dropped it at the big Spider part. Would eventually replay it one day probably hehe |
| Bioshock 1           | I enjoyed the game quite a lot. The biggest strength of the game is its dark and immersive atmosphere. I really appreciated the details in each levels and the environment story telling - each locations always seem to have a backstory tied to it. The underwater setting of Rupture is also stunning and wholy captivated me. My complaints are mostly with the gameplay - while using plasmics is really fun, the hacking and backtracking got tiring real quick, to the point where I stop bothering to hack any machine and just destroy them all on sight. I also do not appreciate story being told through recordings and cassettes - they have their moments but too much is left for the imagination. Overall, 7/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
