>Hedonism is the view that pleasure or happiness is the only thing that’s intrinsically good, and pain or unhappiness is the only thing that’s intrinsically bad

Hedonism only dictates what is intrinsically good or bad; it does not tell you how to maximise them.

- What is pleasure?
	- Positive emotions: joy, pride, intellectual pleasure, artistic pleasure
	- Positive bodily sensation
- What is pain:
	- negative emotions
	- negative sensations

>[!note]
>Hedonists can accept that pleasure can be instrumentally bad, and that pain can be instrumentally good. (E.g.: a pleasure that encourages a dangerous addiction; a pain that prevents you from incurring a more serious injury.)

Why hedonism?
- hard to argue against that pleasure is intrinsically good / pain is intrinsically bad
- hard to think of anything besides pleasure that is intrinsically good
- allow people to live life in different ways because diff people have diff ways to find happiness

Can your pleasure and pain be affected by other wellbeing? Yes.

Problems?
- Pleasure based on false belief?
- Pleasure is **not the only thing** intrinsically good:
	- [[The Experience Machine]]
	- "We learn that something matters to us in addition to experience by imagining an experience machine and then **realizing that we would not use it**."
	- difference between game and machine? we are aware we r in a game
	- "what is the difference btw real life and the machine?": cannot answer duh
	- there are things that can only be achieved by living a real life
