## Network Edge 
The network edge refers to the part of the network that is **closest to end-users or end-devices**, such as laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices. 

It typically includes end-user devices, such as PCs and smartphones, and network access devices, such as modems, routers, switches, and access points. 

The network edge is responsible for connecting end-users to the network and providing them with access to network resources and services.

## Network Core

On the other hand, the network core refers to the part of the network that **provides high-speed connectivity between different parts of the network**, such as data centers, **servers**, and backbone networks.

It typically includes high-speed **routers**, **switches**, and other networking devices that connect different parts of the network and ensure fast and reliable data transmission. 

The network core is responsible for routing and forwarding data packets across the network. [[How is data transmitted in a network]]?
