Essentially, it is a method of teaching computers to make and improve predictions or behaviors based on some data. What is this "data"? Well, that depends entirely on the problem. It could be readings from a robot's sensors as it learns to walk, or the **correct output of a program for certain input.**

A machine is said to learn if it improves its **performance P** on **task T** based on its **experience E.**
- T must be fixed
- P must be measureable
- E must exist.

Eg: A chess playing AI is a learning machine. T = Play chess. E = Experience of playing chess. P is the probability it will win the next match.

Another way to think about machine learning is that it is "**pattern recognition**" - the act of teaching a program to react to or recognize patterns.
