  
In JavaScript, `let` and `var` are used for variable declaration, but they have some important differences in terms of scope and hoisting.

1. Scope:
    
    - `var` variables are function-scoped or globally scoped. They are accessible within the entire function or global scope regardless of block boundaries.
    - `let` variables are block-scoped. They are limited to the block in which they are defined, such as within a loop or conditional statement.
2. Hoisting:
    
    - `var` variables are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means they can be accessed before they are declared. However, their initial value will be `undefined` until the assignment.
    - `let` variables are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until their declaration statement. Accessing a `let` variable before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError.

Here's an example that demonstrates the differences between `var` and `let`:

```js
function example() {
  console.log(x); // undefined
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

  var x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  
  if (true) {
    var x = 30;
    let y = 40;
    console.log(x); // 30
    console.log(y); // 40
  }
  
  console.log(x); // 30
  console.log(y); // 20
}

example();
```

In the example above, `var x` is hoisted, so it can be accessed before its declaration. `let y`, on the other hand, is not hoisted, and accessing it before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError.

Furthermore, `var` variables are subject to variable redeclaration within the same scope, while `let` variables cannot be redeclared within the same block scope.

Given the differences in scoping and hoisting behavior, it is generally recommended to use `let` (or `const` for constants) instead of `var` in modern JavaScript code, as `let` provides more predictable block scoping and helps avoid potential issues caused by hoisting and redeclaration.
