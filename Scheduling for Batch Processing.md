Batch processing have no user interaction, hence response time is not a problem. 

Criteria for Batch Processing:
- Turnaround time: duration between request submission and process completion (waiting time + execution time).
- Throughput: no. tasks **finished**/time
- CPU utilization: percentage of **time** when CPU is working on a task.

**Non-premptive (cooperative)** scheduling algorithm are predominant:
- [[First Come First Served]] (FCFS)
- [[Shortest Job First]] (SJF)

SJF has a preemptive variation:
- [[Shortest Remaining Time]] (SRT)
