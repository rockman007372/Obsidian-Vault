JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, and it is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, but it is **language-independent and can be used with any programming language.**

JSON uses a syntax that is *similar to JavaScript object notation*, with *key-value pairs* separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces. For example, a JSON object representing a person might look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

```

JSON can also represent **arrays** of values, using square brackets to enclose the values and commas to separate them. For example, a JSON array of numbers might look like this:

```json
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

JSON is widely used in **web development** as a **data interchange format**, particularly for APIs and web services. It is a **popular alternative to XML** due to its simplicity and ease of use. JSON can be easily parsed and generated using built-in functions in many programming languages, and it can be easily transferred between different systems and platforms.
