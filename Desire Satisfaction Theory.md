- Definition:
	- your desires being (**objectively, realistically**) satisfied is the only thing that’s intrinsically good for you
	- your desires being frustrated is the only thing that’s intrinsically bad for you
- Attractions:
	- Explain why we do not want to plug into the experience machine ("in the experience machine, **many of our desires are not actually satisfied. We just think that those desires are satisfied**")
	- allow different ways to live life (some people may not desire pleasure. Their lives can still be a good life)
- Objections:
	- DST cannot distinguish btw good and bad desires. Desire satisfaction = intrinsically good.
		- **"A slave wants to serve their master"**. Is this a good life even if their desires are satisfied.
		- abused wife wanting to serve husband
		- a promising youth who wants to commit suicide
		- alcoholic wants to drink alcohol everyday
		- brilliant mathematician wants to count grass in their backyard?
	- Paradox of self-sacrifice:
		- Some people give up their life to save others because they want to.
		- According to DST, this is **not** a sacrifice: they are fulfiling their desires by saving other people, hence they are doing it **in their own interest**.

>[!note]
> Basically, if desires are fulfilled **in real life**, it is intrinsically good.

Example: you think ur petting a cat but its actually not a cat => not intrinsically good according to DST.

Desire vs pleasure: 
- ur desire may be satisfied but u dont know it => no pleasure derived from desire fulfilled.
- u get pleasure thinking ur desire is satisfied but ur desire was NOT ACTUALLY satisfied (experience machine.)
