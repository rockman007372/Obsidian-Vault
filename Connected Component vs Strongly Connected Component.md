## Connected Component vs Strongly Connected Component

Connected Component: Associated with undirected graphs
```
v & w are in a connected component
<=> there is a path from v to w
```

Strongly Connected Components: Associated with directed graph
```
v & w are in a strongly connected component
<=> there is a path from v to w && there is a path from w to v
<=> there is a ROUTE from v to w
```
