## Main Points

What is IQ and what does the IQ test actually measure? → IQs are based on many assumptions and operations during calculation, need to be aware of these complexities before trying to interpret and explain the difference in scores between people

One influence definition of IQ = adaptability. Adaptability = social and cognitive components. Scientists try to ignore social aspect and focus only on cognitive → impossible 

Most agreed definition: abstract reasoning ability.

Scientists cant even define, resort to saying intel is what the IQ test tests. What does it test even?

IQ test purpose: education streaming, resources allocation.

Validation of intelligence test: how to prove the test truly tests what it aims to test? Need an external criteria to judge (educational success) → susceptible to circular reasoning. 

What are the IQ tested intendend to measure:
- **educability** or education success: 
	- Ability to benefit from education offered. However, education success is influenced by social and motivational factors. HENCE, IQ test cannot measures assess only the cognitive, but also social and motivational determinants of school success → cognitive abilities cannot be studied in isolation
- innate **potential**: genetically determined potential ability, prior to any interaction with the environment, and thus independent of educational influences. 
	- Innate amount of potential ability with which a child is endowed at birth sets an upper limit to what he can possibly achieve at school or in after-life → impossible to measure, and does not make sense: potential is expressed in actual behaviors, and cannot measure these behaviours without minimizing the general effects of education and upbringing. Furthermore, there are ways to increase the potentials (genetic technology fixing gene abnormalities)
	- IQ seems to be stable with increasing age. However, this could be due to: 1. Environment being stable as a determinant. 2. IQ score is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as it affects how an individual is subsequently treated - those with low and high IQ receives different education resources. 3. The test is designed with the assumption of constant IQ score, hence it can select test items that yield constant scores.
- General intelligence - **g factor**: are specific types of intelligence correlated? Results are mixed but tend to be yes.

Measuring instrument of IQ:
- Scores cannot be reasoned arithmetically - not an interval scale, but ordinal
- Score is a rank based on how individuals fare against the population.
- Some one with double the IQ does not mean they have double the intelligence

IQ test is standardized against one specific population - white, and is heavily modified to fit a normal distribution.

## Summary
- IQ score expresses an individual's rate of change up a scale of difficulty, relative to others· of the same age group. Scale of difficulty is constructed according to certain statistical criteria to *ensure that the test has certain desirable properties* as a measuring instrument
- The test as a whole is usually **validated**, if at all, against the external criterion of school performance → IQ are correlated with grades simply because the tests are chosen to reflect school performance. 
- Social economic status is not only correlated but also a consequence of education success → IQ is correlated with SES too, just by design.
- Conclusion: IQ is not, and could not be, a measure of cognitive abilities abstracted from all social and motivational factors.
