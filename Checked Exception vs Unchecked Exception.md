In Java, exceptions are categorized as either checked exceptions or unchecked exceptions.

Checked exceptions:
- Checked at compile time
- must be handled, either by **catching** the exception or declaring that the method **throws** the exception.
- Anticipated by programmers (Defensive programming)

Unchecked exception:
- Occur at run time
- Need not be handled
- Unanticipated, usually a bug
