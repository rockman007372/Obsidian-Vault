## Project

### Overview

- Java flashcard application that supports both CLI and GUI.
- It is a team project, consisting of 4 people including me.
- It is a brownfield project, inherited from an existing codebase of a productivity to-do-list application.

### Workflow

- We follow an **iterative and incremental** model (AGILE) in contrast to a **sequential waterfall** model.
	- Stages in software developement life cycle include: gathering requirement, system and architecture design, implementation, testing and deployment.
	- In AGILE, the SDLC include multiple iterations, each iteration go through all development stages and produces a working product by the end. Product is refined and modified to fit new/changing requirements from consumers through each iteration.

- Our team also follows the GIT forking workflow in the beginning:
	- Main remote repo: stores the official version of product
	- Each member has a remote repo that forks from the main repo + a local repo
