# How to Develop a Sense of Scale

## Tips
1. Compare side by side
2. Rescale and resize:
	-   Scale down all the price of items to see how a rich person see money from their perspective. For a person with a net worth of 1 billion (1,000,000,000), when you scale down prices by 100,000 for example, the price of a Macbook M2 (1800) is now like 0.018 bruh
3. Convert to another scale:
	-   1 million seconds is **12 days** (a vacation)
	-   1 billion seconds is **30 years** (a career)
	-   1 trillion seconds is **30,000 years** (longer than human civilization)

## Scale of Money and Inequality

- Jeff Bezos's networth is 183 billion USD. This sounds big until you see the figure, which makes you realise its obscenely, grossly enormous.
