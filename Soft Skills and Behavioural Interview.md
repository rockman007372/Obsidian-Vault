# Soft Skills and Interview Behaviours

## Main Points

#### Self-Introduction

- Sell yourself through self-introduction
- For internships, you should mention the following: 
	- Name 
	- School, 
	- Major 
	- Focus Areas (or skills you are more familiar with) 
	- Past internships and/or noteworthy projects 
- Does this look familiar? Itâ€™s similar to your resume! 
- As you grow in your career, professional experience becomes more important and school background becomes less importanta
- Ask yourself:
	- Is your experience relevant to the company? 
	- Have you used a similar tech stack as the company or built relevant products?
	- What unique talent(s) do you have that gives them confidence about your ability to contribute to the company?

#### Behavioural Interview

Patterns: Just like any normal interview
- Discuss anything written on your resume, and be able to go in-depth
- Provide specific examples about what you did and the resulting impact 
- Critique yourself and share what you learned from a past situation 
- Talk about what you like about your current role and/or being a developer 
- Discuss what and why *changes* you would like to make

 Interviewing is a two-way street. At the end of the interview, you will have time to ask questions. Ask things you are genuinely curious about!

- What is the most important/valuable thing you have learnt from working here? 
- What is the most frustrating part about working here? 
- What challenges do you/your team face at the moment?
- What kinds of projects have interns done? What was the impact of their projects? 
- What kinds of projects will I work on if I join your company as an intern? 
- Will my project be used in production? 
- Can you describe how mentorship works during the internship? Will I be assigned a mentor? 
- What tech stacks does your company use? How do I best prepare myself from now until the start of the internship so that I can set myself up for success?
