# They f you up, your mom and dad

## Main Points

##### Twin experiments
- Identical twin raised separately have very significant correlation in terms intelligence test performance **→ Identical twin pairs who spent their lives apart end up just about as similar in intelligence as those who spent their lives together**.
- Twins IQ difference similar to the difference in 2 different performances in the same individual.
- Some other explanations:
	- 1. The twins **spent time together in their mother’s womb.** 
	- 2. Members of each twin pair might have been placed in very **similar home**s, even though they were separated in early life. Whoever arranged the adoptions might, with humane intent, try to arrange such a state of affairs. Therefore, the separated twins might have lived in very similar environments even though they did not spend their time in contact with each other. 
	- 3.  Not all of these ‘separated’ twins were separated for all of their lives 7 6 before they were united via the MISTRA to take their intelligence tests. **Some had spent some childhood together and some had adult contact**. So, again, there was some opportunity to share environmental influences that might have made their intelligence levels similar
- Did some test → The conclusion was that the effect of being placed in similar environments made only a tiny contribution to the intellectual similarity of the identical twins reared apart. The main influence seemed still to be the genes. → HOW RELIABLE ARE THESE TESTS? HOW **DO YOU EVEN MEASURE ENVIRONMENTAL SIMILARITY?**
- The Minnesota studies that looked at separated twins reckoned that genes contributed about **70 % to the influence on human intelligence differences and environment did the rest** → genes to env = 70 : 30 
- Strangely, it appears that the influence of genes on intelligence grows stronger as humans grow older. The proportion of intelligence differences attributable to genes might be as low as 20 -40 % from infancy to childhood, yet 60% or even quite a bit higher by the time we get into our 70s and 80s

##### An adopted child experiment
- A child is adopted, spend whole life with adopted family. These correlations were measured:
	- Corr betw adopted child and adopted parents
	- corr btw adopted child and birth mother
	- corr btw real unadopted child and adopted parents
	- corr btw adopted siblings.
- Result: Child and birth mother share similar intelligence, not with adopted parent/siblings → Genetics big role in shaping intel?
- Weird finding: birth mothers have higher IQ correlations with the children they had no contact with compared to adoptive parents and their biological offspring who share same family environment.

## Summary

- Lots of research result that shows intelligence is largely affected by genetics, environments play a role but not as significant?
- Existence of g-factor
