> System testing: take the _whole system_ and test it _against the system specification_.

System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).

**System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.** Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' when pushed beyond its limits.

System testing includes testing against **non-functional requirements** too. Examples:

-   _Performance testing_ – to ensure the system responds quickly.
-   _Load testing_ (also called _stress testing_ or _scalability testing_) – to ensure the system can work under heavy load.
-   _Security testing_ – to test how secure the system is.
-   _Compatibility testing, interoperability testing_ – to check whether the system can work with other systems.
-   _Usability testing_ – to test how easy it is to use the system.
-   _Portability testing_ – to test whether the system works on different platform
