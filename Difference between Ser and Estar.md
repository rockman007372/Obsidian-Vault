## What is the difference between Ser and Estar?

There are two verbs that mean “to be” in Spanish, **ser** and **estar**.

-   Ser is used in a simple way, to talk about WHAT something is (**permanent state**). To describe characteristics that are an essential part of the thing we’re talking about.
-   Estar is used to talk about HOW something is, so we use it for conditions, locations, emotions, and actions (**temporary states**).
