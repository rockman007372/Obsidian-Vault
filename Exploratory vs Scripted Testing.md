1.  **Scripted testing:** First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.
2.  **Exploratory testing:** Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.

Note:
- The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.
- **Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time**, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.
