##### Journal

I have not done this in a long time. But I just want to pen down my thoughts right now without any constraints and reservations. I dont know what I am doing with my life. I feel so lost and defeated and demotivated and lost the reason for trying so hard. WHY, did I try so hard back then? Why did I try so hard with math back in vietnam, when I used to redo every single fucking math questions given out during tuition with Mr Thien? Now that I think about it, it was not a bad way of revising for Math anyway, since redoing problems was a proven way of consolidating knowledge. Anyway I digressed. What I am feeling right now is a sense of loss, of unfulfilment and discontent. I have unhappy in university, and feel like i am not living to my fullest potentials. What are my potentials anyway? What do I want to do in life? Is coding what I really want? FUCK it, I think I do enjoy the process of coding. I had much fun with doing assignments and labs in the past. Solving leetcode questions were also pretty fulfilling if I manage to come up with a solution, or simply understand the given solution. Then why do I feel so unfulfilled? I think I lost my drive after my terrible performance at cs2109 midterm. Why do you think I did so badly? I froze so hard at the end, I could not think straight. WHY DID I not put anything down? What were I afraid of? I had the idea, I remember seeing the question and even solution to it before. There was NO reason why I should not have put down something, anything. All you have to do is to demonstrate that you have learned and understood something. Maybe in the end I did not learn that much. Maybe I did not absorb the knowledge as much as I thought I did. DO NOT blame your intelligence? No, you have to embrace it, not deny it. I am not the smartest person in the room. Do I have to be? NO, definitely not. I am sure I can grow to be better at whatever I am doing. The question is, why do you want to be better? Do you even want to be better? I dont know. I also have to revisit my learning method. Am I doing the right thing? I dont think I need to type out everything from the lecture notes. What is the point of the lecture notes if I copy paste everything from the notes anyway? Unless the lecture note is bad, I dont think there is an urgent need for me to make notes anymore? NO, I should still make notes, but I should focus less on the minute details and care more about the general application? Easier said than done, but I think I just have to be conscious of this while taking notes. Dont be lost in the details, you will forget it all eventually,  but the materials will always be there to remind you. Focus on the bigger concepts. I must admit, as pretentious and pompous and elitist as Ben Leong is, his advice do make sense every now and then. Just like how a broken clock can still be right twice a day. Just have to focus the bigger picture. 

Now, what have I done recently to improve myself? I think I have been trying to improve my communication skills. I do think it has been quite stunted ever since I landed in Singapore. I have become too self-conscious and therefore withdrawn from basic conversation. I did recognize my nervousness when speaking with certain people or in certain scenarios. I am aware that I speak very fast and incohenrenly whenever I devolve into a nervous wreck. To combat this, the answer is clear and straightforward: I just have to speak SLOWER and enunciate CLEARER. I have reminded myself this over and over in the past, and its time to bring back the reminder. Anyway, I am sure this will come with practice and exposure. I just have to remember that these communication attempts are simply just practice. I do not have to nail every single conversation I have. And I have to trust that no one will give a flying fuck about my slip-ups - People make slipups all the time in conversation. Just have to keep trying and be consistent. Talking about  consistency, gyming routing has taken a nosedive the past 1 week. Midterms stress and backlog have taken a massive toll on my mental health. I just simply not been working out as much as I would like to. I wonder if I can resume the routine once midterm is over, considering all the backlogs I have accumulated.
