### Reflection:
##### Journal
So shag HAHA there are really a lot of things to do today :'') Im glad I managed to gym amidst all this madness. Chest and triceps babyyy.

I watched the first lecture of cs2105 and didnt remember much. That prof needs some enunciation lesson man fuck. It seems kinda dry right now too so I really hope I will not slack behind in this mod.

Have yet to finish first lecture of cs2100. Will finish tmr. **Wrist hurts a lot right now, need to rest!!** Did vim tutorial until chapter 2 too btw.

##### Gratitude
Jowi for gyming w me.

##### To Be Improved
