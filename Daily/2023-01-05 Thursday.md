## Reflection
#### Thoughts 
I cannot swallow in my own misery any longer. I have a family to take care of. Everything depends on me now. I do not have a choice. I cannot be sentimental anymore. This is for my own protection as well as the good of my loved ones. Fuck feelings, fuck self-blaming. 

Cracked Photoshop and Illustrator for bro. Hope he will appreciate it. Wish him all the best.
