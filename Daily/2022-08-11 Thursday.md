### Reflection
##### Journal
Fucking tired. Had my first seminor seminar today. It was slightly stressful because everyone was very vocal and love contributing ideas and opinions. But I get it, you do not have to always come up with something brilliant or thought provoking. You are under wayyy too much stress. Relax and just enjoy the intellectual stimulation. Your english may not be the best, but fuck it? At the end of the day, who will give a flying fuck? You got this.

I was stationing for a flockfest game. I was not hyped enough at some point, but to be fair I was just matching the flock energy and I was fucking exhausted. Glad I managed to bring up some energy towards the end.

##### Gratitude
Vienne. Sahil for being a good role model in terms of being eloquent and confident in his vocal deliveries?? tf am i saying. 

##### To Be Improved
Confidence in sharing ideas and participating in SS. I can prepare the readings better and try to envision what kind of things that we be asked and do research on these topics first.
