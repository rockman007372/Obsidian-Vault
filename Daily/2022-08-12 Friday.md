### Reflection
##### Journal
Last day of orientation. I feel so socially exhausted :( Met a bunch of new peeps. Dont know if im making at a good impression. I was not exactly the most sociable today :/ It is really true that I am better at 1 on 1 conversation compared to group conversation and I really want to fix that :/ Remembering names is also a struggle but I am trying really hard to get the hang of it too. Made shit tons of social slip ups, but wtf, who care!! REMEMBER no one dwell on it except yourself :) Fuck people who you dont vibe with, they dont deserve your energy in the first place! 

##### Gratitude
Grateful for Vienne for being caring and understanding and loving as always.
For the people I met and vibe with today! Gotta rmb their name: Justin, Ian, Wei Lun, Sam Nicole Elizabeth, Roberto, Sherie, Azkia, the malay girl name (Ishira??), Aiya?? 

Also hung out and talked with Praveen. Pretty cool dude too!

##### To Be Improved
Dont dwell too much over social slipups. Just be yourself, and just make convo! It will all get better with practice, I promise you :)_
