### Reflection
##### Journal
So tired man. Waking up late AGAIN. Then went back, did a bit of cs2109s PS0 until im recruited for fking hcom log preps again. THEN, I have to station game for the first day of finale. 

After a shower i felt better LOL. Can continue with my reflection. I think, my station was funny for some people, and that's good enough. I had supper with Danial and Brandon, and we surprisingly vibed pretty damn well. Went back to tembu and talked to a few more (Kok and Daphne). I carried myself well I think! It's really all about confidence. For once in a long time, suddenly I stop caring so much about height! It does not faze me at all, and I guess the trick is to just feel like everyone is the same height as me. They are not that tall, that's what I believe. And it really works. Height is really just exaggerated in my head all this time LOL. I can do this. I can be myself again.

##### Gratitude
Siyu for reminding me of whom I was. Brandon for hanging with me. Kok is nice and easy to vibe with too! The 2 juniors, Chloe and Wei Lun are also very affable and easy-going. 

##### To Be Improved
Time management. Phone usage. Perennial enemies of mine.
