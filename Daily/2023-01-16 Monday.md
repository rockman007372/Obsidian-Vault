## Reflection
#### Thoughts 

Too much distraction last night. I couldnt achieve much, and by then it was already late and I wanted to sleep. Had dajavu of last sem. MUST RESOLVE THIS ASAP WHEN I STILL HAVE TIME.

Distractions:
- Phone: Must put it somewhere else
- Youtube: Only music allowed? BUT I KEEP GETTING DISTRACTED :/ NO MUSIC? NO, NO YOUTUBE → soundcloud?
- Food: Eat at least 2 portions so I dont get hungry at night.
