###### Thoughts of the Day
I managed to gym today. That was probably the biggest achievement of the whole day. I spent almost the whole day with Vienne and I love every moment with her. However, I got ed again. I was not anticipating we would be doing it today, didnt sleep early enough and did not take the pills. I have to live with taking pills, dont I? I am sad and disappointed, but I shall not fall into the self-perpetual cycle of depression and self-destruction. Writing down my thoughts and doing sth productive do well to distract my thoughts. Perhaps I can talk to Vienne abt how I feel. Feel quite self-conscious abt myself today, my height and my body. Maybe this also affects ED. When will I be happy about my body? 

Remember Nghia, there are things you cant change. But you can play with your cards, and you can still win. Dress well, continue to be active, be patient with your toe, you will come back stronger. Vienne loves you, and if she doesnt anymore, it is ok. You are self sufficient. It would hurt badly, but you have been through worse. Just, focus on giving and being generous. If she does not need it anymore, its her loss.
