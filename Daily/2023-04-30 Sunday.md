## Reflection

### 3 noteable things that happened today
- Mom called, telling me grandma is in critical health condition. She wants me to go back as soon as possible before grandma passes. I already booked my flight ticket on the 11th, and I am quite certain I cannot change the flight date. What should I do? I dont mind going back earlier, I need to suppport my mom and see grandma alive one last time. I felt some resentment for mother, to be completely honest. But I also recognized how much she had gone through and sacrificed for me. I would not be here in my current situation, be it a desirable and unpleasnt one, were it not for her. I dont know, why did she do what she did? I already told her to be careful, extremely be careful. I should have been cautious with the crypto currency bullshit - I am more than educated enough to advice her. I was not a child at the poin, I was a grown man studying a computer science degree. I could have easily done my own research and adviced her to stop being so reckless. When I heard about that operation that involved such a large amount of money, I already told her to be very careful. To check whether there are legal bindings and all that bullshit. How is she so delusional and reckless? I knew she raised me, but she was certainly not without fault. She did not have any long-lasting relationship, and people probably did not like her as much as the impression she had given us. The more I think about it, the more I pity father. I hope the trip gives them the much needed distraction and respite from the horrible ordeal at home.
