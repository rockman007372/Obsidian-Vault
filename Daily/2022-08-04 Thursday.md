###### Thoughts of the Day
Super fun day with Vienne. Makes me very grateful for her. We went to Playnation where we played console games and had unlimited snacks and drinks. Felt more like a anniversary date instead of a casual date. 

We also went clothes shopping and we managed to cop some really good and well-fitting clothes (hard to find the right clothes for my size sadly - reminder to check waist level and shoulder length!!).

After arriving home from the date, I went to ball with Jowi and Andrew to practice for the next day training, and also to test out my toe. Result is far from idea: my toe hurts like a bitch. 

Once back, I played Castle Crasher with Kok Hai and Yi Jia. Solid lads, Yi Jia is a beast at video games. Then I stayed up very late playing game while talking with Vienne (and even after she has gone to sleep). Horrible decision. Will need to remind myself WHY i must not sleep so late :/ 

Overall, fantastic day with an anticlimatic ending.
