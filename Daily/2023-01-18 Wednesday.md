## Reflection
### Thoughts 
I am spending way too much time bogged down in the details. It will come naturally to me when I use it in practice. For now, learn with breadth, paste down info into obsidian if its helpful, then move the fuck on. Agreeable?

Also dont know why I cannot sleep sound :/ woke up earlier today too for no reason. Fuck it, I overthink too much. This is not important right now.

### Learning
