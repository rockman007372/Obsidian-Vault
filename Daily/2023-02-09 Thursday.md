## Reflection

### 3 noteable things that happened today
- I had [[UTC2105]] seminar in the morning. Contributed 2 comments. One of them is just a question to initiate exchanges in class.
- Had a presentation for [[CS2101]]. My part was done alright, I feel I made quite a few slip-ups. But the rest seemed to enjoy the energy I brought. I hope I have better content to present next time. 
- Played bball really well today. I was more confident about my ability, and tried to be more aggressive. It paid off :)
