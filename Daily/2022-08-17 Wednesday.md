### Reflection
##### Journal
Man last night was sth else. I coughed so hard I bled, and I couldnt sleep until 5. Woke up from some low ass quality sleep at 12. Met with Vienne, had a good lunch together, but then I had to rush to meet the deadline for entry 1 of the SS journal (Spoiler: I missed it). 

I managed to finish processing some 2105s and 2100 notes, but I will be honest that I was so exhausted from note-taking. I also feel like there must be a way to take more efficient notes :( Right now I feel like taking notes on OneNote is the most efficient and fastest, but I do believe processing my notes in Obs is better in the long run. The question is when should I start processing my notes?? Maybe, I can do it over the weekend.. Because right now it is taking way too much of my time :( 

I had the Interview for TEmpowered at night. The interviewers were 15 min late, can you imagine LMAO. Anw, I think I did an ok job, some questions threw me offguard but generally I am prepared for most of them. I also think I presented myself well enough, but I am not so sure. I mentioned introspection as my strength and used this daily journal as evidence, which is a quality I would never have assigned to myself in the past. Anw, I feel so tired but not tired enough to sleep :/ Will try to sleep earlier, perhaps at 12:30 today.. Until then, POMODORO awayy

##### Gratitude
Vienne. 

##### To Be Improved
Sleep schedule man, you know its much harder to sleep beyond 3. 
Having a bad sleep also affects my performance and productivity a lot, so something has to be done :/ Also prepare tissue and cough sprayers for tonight.
