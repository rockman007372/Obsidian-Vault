###### Thoughts of the Day
Man, I didnt do jackshit today. Slept until 12pm. Had lunch, then slept again until 7pm!! In my defense, I was very tired from last night depression and the weather was extra nice. 

I went to attend tCali. Tried to do handstand but now my wrist kinda hurts. Gotta be careful LOL.
