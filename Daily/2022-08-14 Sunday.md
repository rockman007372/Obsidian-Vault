### Reflection
##### Journal
I cant remember anything abt today but I know it was a pretty unproductive day full of procrastination. I managed to do some work by thinking of the positive outcomes of doing such work, which is a tip in the Atomic Habits book. However, I am still very easily distracted and waste a lof of time thinking of what to do instead of doing anything.

Are there any solution to this? Usually when im distracted, I will go out of my room. However, with my 2nd monitor here it would be very hard to do so. I must make use of other Atomic Habits tips to overcome this inertia. 

Okay I just checked the tips. All very useful and logical. I will attempt to try the 2-minute rule (scale down design outcome) and temptation bundling in the next few days whenever I feel like procrastinating.

One good thing today is when I did core, I felt much improvement in my core strength and managed to do so many more reps :) I also managed to gym, so keep it up!
