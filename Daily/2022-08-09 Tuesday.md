### Reflection
##### Journal
Long ass day, so exhaused :') Notably, I bought a monitor for 144sgd! I hope its value for money :') Cant wait to set up my work/study space! 

The rest of the day is spent watching cs2100 lectures and taking notes in One Note. Dreading having to decypher the scribbles and make atomic notes on Obsidian :')

##### Gratitude
Vienne for hanging out with me! Jo and Andrew for food i guess.. Should hang out with people in hall more!

##### To Be Improved
