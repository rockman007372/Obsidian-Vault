### 3 noteable things that happened today

Injury report: **shoulder and left knee** :( But i figured out how to shoot better today!! Basically, my problem is my left hand is too close to my right hand when i shoot. I feel SO MUCH better and in more control when i slide my left hand nearer towards the top of the ball!

Anyway, must rest up my shoulder and my knee for the next few days. Will keep track of them
