The program is responsible for making decisions and measuring its performance, but occasional positive/negative feedbacks are given.

Example: Â Teaching a robot how to navigate by giving a *negative penalty* whenever its bump sensor detects that it has bumped into an object. If coded correctly, it is possible for the robot to eventually *correlate its range finder sensor data with its bumper sensor data and the directions that sends to the wheels*, and ultimately choose a form of navigation that results in it not bumping into objects.
