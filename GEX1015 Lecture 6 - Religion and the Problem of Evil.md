[[Dialogue on good, evil and the existence of god]]

# Content

All-perfect god:
1. Omnipotent (all-powerful)
2. Omniscient (all-knowing)
3. Omnibenevolent (morally perfect)

The existence of an all-perfect god is inconsistent with the existence of evils.

Argument:
P1. If an all-perfect god exists, then no evil exists
P2. Evils exist
C. An all perfect god does not exist.

Counter-argument: P1 is false because evils are necessary for a greater good.

1. We would not appreciate good things in life unless we are exposed to bad things too.
	1. Sure, why do we need **so much** evil to appreciate good things? (holocaust)
	2. What abt bad things that happen without our knowledge?
2. Evil is necessary for spritual development.
	1. Why do we need so much evil to do so?
	2. What abt suffering of animals? or suffering of children who died young who had no chance to develop spiritually?
	3. Why some spiritually undeveloped people never suffer at all?
3. Evil is a necessary consequence of humans having **free will.**
	1. Do we even have free will?
	2. Why does god not intervene to prevent the most horrendous outcome of free will? Why must it be mutually conclusive? 
	3. How about natural evils (natural disasters)
4. Humans have insufficient knowledge to see the greater good stemming from evils.
