## What is DOM

The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, is a **programming interface** for web documents. It is a **hierarchical tree-like structure** that represents the elements, attributes, and content of an HTML or XML document as objects. 

The DOM provides a way for web developers to interact with the elements of a web page, and to manipulate their content, style, and behavior through scripting.

[[JavaScript]] is commonly used to interact with the DOM, allowing developers to write code that can dynamically modify the content and behavior of web pages in response to user interactions or other events. See [[JavaScript DOM Manipulation]].
