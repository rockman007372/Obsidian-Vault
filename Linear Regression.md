- Linear regression is a class of [[Supervised Learning]]
- Given inputs over a continuous range, predict result within a continuous output. 
- Example: Given the area of a property, predict its price.

>[!Goal]
> Given a **training set** of N example input-output pairs $(x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_2), \text{...}$ where each $y_j$ is generated by an unknown $x_j$ through a function $y = f(x)$, **discover a function h that approximates** the true function f.
