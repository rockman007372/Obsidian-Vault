Common forms of testing SUT (Software Under Test):

1. [[Unit Testing]]
2. [[Regression Testing]]
3. [[Integration Testing]]
4. [[System Testing]]
5. [[Acceptance Testing]]
6. [[Alpha Beta Testing]]
7. [[Exploratory vs Scripted Testing]]

Note:
- 1 to 4 are done by developers, while 5 to 6 are done by other testers.
- Ideally, we perform the above testing through [[Test Automation]] instead of doing manual testing.

## Testing techniques and concepts

1. [[Dependency Injection]]
2. [[Test Driven Development]]
3. [[Test Coverage]]
4. [[Test Cases]]
