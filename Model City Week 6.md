# Theory & Methodology of Urban Interventions

## What to talk about

### Celebrating the mundane: adding cultural value to physical interventions

- Glasgow is located _on the banks of the River Clyde, in West Central Scotland_
- Jan Gehl: His work has been influential in the field of urban design, and has helped to shift the focus of city planning away from car-centric models and towards more livable, people-friendly urban environments.
- To enrich place-making process, **culture work** is a commnon approach. → may be *deemed as contrived without being handled sensitively*
- To rich a cultural mix may be hard to digest, should be small scale with occasional burst of extravagance.
- **Royston road project**: 
	- Local radio station
	- rose-naming competition
	- writing workshop
	- made to nurture positive use
	- connect to wider issues of housing stock transfer and social and economic regeneration
- **The coach house trust**: Teach skills while providing a genuine local service
	- start as a project to support skills development for disabled people
	- grown into a successful social enterprise (nursery, on-site kitcehn, recycling facil, ....)
	- Became a local resource (garden for quiet retreat)

Conclusion: These projects introduce people to the pleasures of collaborative work in the outdoors; engage children and adults in creating stimulating outdoor environments.

Who initialise and plan these projects? Investment and funding? Hard to create real-life partnership:
- Demand vision from the top yet suspicious of top-down thinking
- Encourage local initiative, but lacks a wider view


### What is "celebrating the mundane" in urban design 

"Celebrating the mundane: adding cultural value to physical interventions" is a concept in urban design that emphasizes the importance of **incorporating cultural meaning and significance into everyday, functional elements of the urban environment**. The idea is that by adding elements of cultural value to otherwise mundane physical interventions, such as benches, streetlights, and sidewalks, designers can **enhance the quality of life and sense of place** for people in the urban environment.

The concept of celebrating the mundane is based on the idea that the **physical environment of a city can have a significant impact on the social and cultural life of its inhabitants**. By adding cultural value to physical interventions, designers can create more vibrant, inclusive, and meaningful public spaces that reflect the values, histories, and identities of the people who use them.

Examples of celebrating the mundane in urban design might include **adding public art to bus stops or installing seating that incorporates historical or cultural references**. These types of interventions can help to create a sense of place and community in the urban environment, while also enhancing the function and usability of everyday elements of the built environment.

The concept of celebrating the mundane is related to other design approaches that prioritize the social and cultural aspects of urban design, such as placemaking, tactical urbanism, and participatory design. These approaches all seek to create more livable, sustainable, and equitable cities by involving people in the design process and **emphasizing the human-centered qualities** of the built environment.

### Celebrating the mundane in Singapore

- Toa Payoh was one of Singapore's first HDB towns, built in the 1960s as part of the country's public housing program.
- Toa Payoh Dragon Playground - very old, in 1970s, neighborhood icon
- Toa Payoh Town Center: Linking different neighbourhoods together through a centralised network of pedestrian pathways, parks, and public spaces that encouraged social interaction and community building. These public spaces were designed with a focus on cultural significance, with many of them featuring public art, sculptures, and murals that celebrate the heritage and identity of the town's inhabitants.

### Play and urban realm

"Play and the urban realm" is a chapter from "The Ludic City: Exploring the Potential of Public Places" by Quentin Stevens. The chapter discusses the importance of play in the design of urban spaces and the potential **benefits of incorporating playful elements into public places**.

The author argues that play is a **fundamental human need** and that urban spaces can provide important opportunities for play and exploration. He suggests that play can *enhance the quality of life in urban environments and promote social interaction and community building.* 

The chapter explores different forms of play, including **structured and unstructured play**, and suggests ways that urban designers can incorporate playful elements into public spaces. Examples of playful design elements include **swings, climbing structures, and interactive art installations.**

The author also discusses the potential challenges and limitations of incorporating play into urban design, such as **safety concerns and the need to balance playfulness with functionality and accessibility**.

Overall, the chapter highlights the potential benefits of incorporating play into urban design and emphasizes the importance of creating public spaces that are engaging, inclusive, and promote social interaction and community building.

Example: 
- Giant Chess Set in Singapore Sport Hub 
- Open spaced neighborhood basketball courts (in the middle of HDB): pick-up games, anyone can form team and play, form neighborhood identity and cohesion. 
- "Competitive displays occur in urban settings which draw people together in front of an appreciative audience" → that basketball court in toa payoh

## Intervention Project

- Context-specific with specific stakeholders in mind
- Need to have social critiques 
- Some examples:
	- Wallpaper Dumpsters
	- Lego fix breakages
	- plastic bag air inflated by train
	- Creating interesting socal space
	- Humour
- Ideas:
	- Make elevator more friendly?
