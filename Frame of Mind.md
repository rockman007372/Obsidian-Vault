## Main Points
A human beings, we are better described as having a set of relatively autonomous intelligences, despite the age-old focus on linguistic and logical ablities as the sole measurement of intelligence.

Three distint definition of the term *intelligence*:
- A property of all human beings (we possess these 8 or 9 intelligences)
- A dimension on which human beings differ. (No two people - not even twin - possess the same profile of intelligence)
- The way in which one carries out a task in virtue of ones's goals - intrinsic motivations

Intelligence is not the same as learning styles. It is also not a societal domain (musical intelligence misconfounded as matery for a certain musical genre).

Some even try to ascribe certain intelligence types to racial and ethnic groups.

 Dr. Gardner addresses his **eight classifications** for intelligence: 
 - Linguistics (the art of using words), 
 - Mathematical and logical (IQ), 
 - Musical (appreciate, conduct, produce music, tones, rhythm, tempo...) 
 - Spatial (surgent, chess player, pilots), 
 - Kinesthetic (atheles, dancers, handcraft artists), 
 - Interpersonal (understanding others, such as leaders, salemen), 
 - Intrapersonal (understand yourself).
 - Naturalist intelligence (ability to distinguish different animal and plant species)

Some intelligence types under research:
 - Pedagogical intelligence: Ability to teach
 - Existential intelligence: Ability to ask big philosophysical questions

Some even more interesting intelligence:
- Humour intelligence: It is more of like a logical intelligence, only we flip the logic at the end to subvert expectations
- Sexual intelligence: ?? HMMM ability to have satisfactory sex

Life is short, no time to develop all types of intelligence. The big question is, should we try to be Jack of all trades or we play to our own strengths?

## Criticisms and rebuttals:
1. Terminology: Talents and intelligence are not the same, intelligence should be reserved for general kinds of capacities.
	1. Sure, one can define words anyway they want. However, in delineating a narrow definition of intelligence, we are devaluing those capacities not within that definition. 
	2. Musical and Spatial ability are no less of an intelligence or talent than Logics and Maths. "it is fine to call music or spatial ability a talent, so long as one calls language or logic a talent as well."
2. Correlation Among Intelligence:
	1. Some argues for general intelligence, which correlates with all other kinds of intelligence
	2. However, we do not have any conclusive proof. All the studies that measure correlations are flawed in the way they test intelligence, which is **heavily skewed towards liguistic and logical abilities.**
3. Style over substance: 
	1. list of intelligences resembles lists put out by researchers interested in learning styles, working styles, personality styles, human archetypes, and the like;
	2. The methods used to derive are unique and grounded in science.
4. The inner working of intelligence: the book is too descriptive, lack the processes whereby mental activities are carried out.
	1.  There are no conclusive models to simulate the brains and cognitive functions YET.
5. Can still be misused just like traditional inteligence
	1. MI theory was devised as a scientific theury only and not as an instrument of social policy. Like any other theory, it can be put to different uses by different people; it is not possible, and may not be appropriate, for the originator of a theory to attempt to control the ways in which it is used.
