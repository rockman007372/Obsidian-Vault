Implicit Theories of Intelligence and Achievement Goals: A Look at Students’ Intrinsic Motivation and Achievement in Mathematics

Growth mindset and motivation: a study into secondary school science learning

Testing the association of growth mindset and grades across a challenging transition: Is growth mindset associated with grades?

72 per cent of Singaporean students revealed that they are anxious about how others would perceive them when they fail - 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). Being _kiasu_ is the hallmark of a being Singaporean student – with high-stakes national exams and assessments for academic and non-academic activities. While this fear of losing to others may drive students to work hard but it may also ingrain an unhealthy mindset that focuses purely on outcomes and returns.

Meritocracy in Singaporean Educational System: Inequality in Admission to Secondary Schools → The paper argues that meritocracy has posed a threat to equality in admission to secondary schools in Singapore. The findings indicate that the meritocratic policy does not recognize both the importance of family SES and the gap between elite schools and neighbourhood schools in the Singapore education system. Students with wealthy and well-educated parents and students in elite schools are more likely to acquire better educational attainment, since they tend to gain more cultural capital from family and social capital from school. The principle of meritocracy fails to allocate opportunities fairly to students and can lead to inequality in education and exacerbate educational stratification.

##### Singapore policy to survive
- Maximise potential of people through meritocracy
- Focus on developing a strong competent workforce
- Streaming → FInd the intellectuals in the population and grant them more resources
- National narative echoing hard work is the only way up → national productivity campaign, productivity Bee mascot
- Knowledge economy
- Survival mentality of the nation translated to a personal level 

##### Factors limiting the efficacy of growth mindset
Performance-focused task:
- Too much performance focus, not enough time  to develop growth mindset
- there is an emphasis on separating the clever and talented from those who are less able.
- Mindset Works Best When Goals Are Learning-Orientated → if performance is the sheer focus, you may gain more motivation from trying to beat the rest
- Singapore context: very relevant

Mindset is made too easy to develop:
- Easy to overlook context and nuances
- Growth mindset is oversimplified to try hard and you will succeed

##### What is a false growth mindset
- Believing you already have growth mindset → people are rarely in one mindset type, a mixture of both. Many triggers can prompt reversal to fixed mindset
- Praise the effort, not the outcome is a bad idea → praise the efforts that are tied with good results. 

##### Structural inequalities and growth mindset
Can structural inequalities give rise to psychological inequalities and can the same pyschological inequalities reinforce the impact of structural inequalities on achievement and opportunities?


## Implicit Intelligence theory
- Humans have often subconscious  beliefs about intelligence (implicit theory): incremental and entity
- Two ways of defining success—attainment of mastery (self-referenced success) and outperforming others (other-referenced success).
- Motivation goals: 4 types - mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, performance-avoidance

## Big question: Can a growth mindset thrive in Singapore?


- cannot thrive:
	- Poor understanding of the growth mindset, neoliberal state, puts so much responsibility on students, less on educator and the environment. Teachers praise efforts without analysing why the efforts fail. Just do practice papers mindlessly without reviewing
	- Early streaming and labelling, how to have a growth mindset when you are labelled as stupid and non-academic → psychological inequalities
	- Highstake exams that detemine whole future → culture of self-comparison and competitiveness → defeats the effectiveness of growth mindset. Mindset Works Best When Goals Are Learning-Orientated → if performance is the sheer focus, you may gain more motivation from trying to beat the rest


Do you believe that intelligience is flexible, malleable, and capable of growth given enough time and effort are invested? Or are you of the belief that intelligence is a fixed innate quality that is set for life the moment you were born? Under the Implicit Theories of Intelligence (Dweck et al., 1995; Dweck, 2000), the former notion falls under a growth mindset, and the latter a fixed mindset. Since the introduction of these mindset theories, they have attracted large scholastic and public attention, quickly making its way into education and workplace reform policies across the globe. A quick Google search can lead to a myriad of newspaper and research articles extolling the virtues of a growth mindset, quoting decades of studies on the positive impacts of a growth mindset on personal success, achievements and fulfilment. Given this abundance of benefits associated with a growth mindset, it comes as no surprise that the Singapore governments have introduced many policies to inculcate a growth mindset into its students over the years.  In this article, I will introduce the theories of mindsets and explore the effects on growth mindset on its practitioners. I will also argue that the current Singapore environment may not be conducive enough for the development of a growth mindset, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the mindset theory, a hypercompetitive education system and psychological inqualities stemming from early streaming. 

Before we can have meaningful discussion about the mindsets towards intelligence, it is beneficial to establish what intelligence is defined as in the modern world. Traditionally, intelligence is considered a general cognitive ability that facilitates logical reasoning, abstract thinking, comprehending challenging ideas and solving novel problems (**source** g factor here). However,  Howard Gardner challenged that intelligence is heavily context-dependent and cannot be measured by conventional psychometric tests such as the IQ test . Instead, intelligence is a composition of smaller subsets of intelligence that may be measured through the ability to produce ideas and products valuable to a culture (**source**). While the definitions of intelligence may vary and are subject to much contention, they all form the foundation for the implicit theories of intelligence proposed by the eminent psychologist Carol Dweck and her colleagues.

The implicit theories of intelligence refers to an individual's underlying belief system regarding the changability of intelligence ([Carol Dweck et al., 1995](Dweck, C. S., Chiu, C. and Hong, Y. 1995. Implicit theories and their role in judgments and reactions: A world from two perspectives. _Psychological Inquiry_, 6: 267–285.)). Carol and her team proposed that there are two theories associated with intelligence, the incremental theory and the entity theory. Those subscribing to the incremental theory (and hence possessing a "growth mindset") believes that intelligence is flexible and can be strengthened through sustained efforts and perseverance. Meanwhile, individuals holding an entity theory (and hence, a "fixed mindset") believe that everyone is born with a static and predetermined amount of intelligence irrespective of the efforts put in. To understand the impacts of mindsets on individuals, it is crucial to understand how mindsets shape and influence intrinsic motivations and achievement goals.

Mindset is a predictor of achievement goals, defined as the reasons behind one's motivation to achieve (**source**). Generally, the incremental believers tend to pursue mastery goals; they are more focused on the learning process and the pursuit of knowledge. Their definition of success is tied to the extent to which they have mastered concepts, knowledges and skills. They attribute their success to their efforts and recognize the intrinsic values of learning. In contrast, the entity theorists tend to share performance goals. They are usually more preoccupied with obtaining good performance outcomes, in order to gain positive validation of their intellectual abilities. Success to them is the ability to outperform others, or achieve goals with greater ease than the norm. While incremental theorists see failures and poor performance outcomes as feedbacks for their efforts and learning strategies, entity theorists consider setbacks as evidence for their intellectual inadequacy. 

Hence, it perhaps come as no surprise that there is abundant evidence pointing to the benefits of having a growth mindset over a fixed mindset. Researchers show that the growth mindset is a stronger predictor of academic achievement relative to the fixed mindset ([Blackwell et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.593715/full#ref5); [Burnette et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.593715/full#ref9); [Romero et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.593715/full#ref69); [Bostwick et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.593715/full#ref8)). Those who hold or were taught a growth mindset also tend to develop greater resilience in the face of academic and social challenges, and are not afraid to take risks and fail (Yeager, 2012). 

In light of these benefits, the Singapore education system has made attempts to incorporate the growth mindset into the curriculum. Under the Teach Less Learn More movement which gave schools more agency in developing their own curriculum, some secondary schools in Singapore have come up with ways to nurture growth mindset in class. (**quote**) At Waterway Primary School, students even have lessons dedicated to teaching students the importance of embracing the growth mindset and ways to cultivate it (**link to website**).  Additionally, the themes of growth mindset also surfaced in the national initiatives aimed at promoting lifelong learning and upskilling of the workforce. For example, the SkillFuture movement's mission statement claims it tries to promote "a mindset of continually striving towards greater excellence through knowledge, application and experience". 

Despite all these efforts, I am sceptical as to whether a growth mindset can be successfully cultivated in the Singapore education system, as well as the extent of benefits Singapore students may reap from a growth mindset in the Singapore context. Firstly, I am of the concern that the concept of growth mindset may be perversed under the neoliberal settings of Singapore. Neoliberlism refers to a set of market-oriented policies that shift responsibilities away from the state and towards individual agency. In a neoliberal society, individuals have the moral obligation to invest in themselves to maximize their personal capitals, which are considered building blocks for success (Larner, 2009) .  Given the pervasive neoliberal themes entrenched in Singapore's policies, it is a valid concern that Singapore may take the same neoliberal approach to promoting the growth mindset to its citizens. For example, the growth mindset may be advertised as a necessary capital to succeed in life, and pressure is placed on students to cultivate a growth mindset and eliminate any traces of a fixed mindset as soon as possible for the sake of their own development. Instead of creating a positive learning environment where curiosity is rewarded and a growth mindset is nurtured, schools may shift the responsibility to students to appreciate and practice the growth mindset on their own, as yet another necesssary skill to acquire through the education system. The lack of accountability on the side of educators may limit the development of the growth mindset in students, as mindsets are not something easily adopted through sheer will, but through the environment and culture that students are brought up in. 

Secondly, Singapore's early ability streaming and high-stake examination culture may present challenging obstacles to the development of the growth mindset in its students. Before the upcoming abolishment of streaming in 2024, Singapore students entering secondary schools were streamed into different academic programs based on their PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) performance. Those in lower-progress streams were often negatively labelled as less academically competent or hardworking. Hence, it is reasonable to assume many of these students may internalise the negative stigma surrounding their incompetency, and blame their lack of innate intelligence for their being placed in lower streams. Furthermore, it is known that social economic status (SES) also greatly predicted which streams students would enter. Those from lower SES are more likely to be streamed to lower-progress programs (SOURCE).  Since parents from lower SES tend to not have been academically successful in their days, students from lower stream may be tempted to ascribe their lack of academic success to genetics, a factor beyond their control. Furthermore, these parents may also view their children's low performance as 

This fixed mindset would in turn reduce many students' intrinsic motivation to learn and gain knowledge, as they already come to terms with the fact they cannot be as "smart" as their higher-progress counterparts.










Furthermore,
this zero-sum interpretation of the mindset theory that blindly idealizes the growth mindset and demonizes the fixed mindset is what Carol Dweck described as a "false growth mindset" (**QUOTE**). The truth is nobody has a growth or fixed mindset all the time, but a mixture of both that arise individually in different situations. While one may possess a predominant growth mindset towards academic activitites, he or she may still resort to a fixed mindset when it comes to a completely unrelated field such as sport or music. Through the mindset theory, Carol hopes to help people acknowledge the fixed mindset traits that may surface when they are met with difficulties and setbacks, and learn to focus on the learning process and the joy of learning instead.
