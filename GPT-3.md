# GPT-3
### Main Points

GPT-3, or the third generation Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a neural network [machine learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) model trained using internet data to generate any type of text. 

Developed by [OpenAI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/OpenAI), it requires a small amount of input text to generate large volumes of relevant and sophisticated machine-generated text.

GPT-3 is the largest neural network ever produced.

GPT-3 is better than any prior model for producing text that is convincing enough to seem like a human could have written it.
