Most programs exhibit these behaviors:
- Most time are spent on a relatively small part of code only
- In a time period, accesses are made to a relatively small part of data only

Locality principles:
- **Temporal** Locality: Memory address which is used is likely to be used again
- **Spatial** Locality: Memory addresses close to a used address is likely to be used
