# Alpha Go
### Main Points
**AlphaGo** is a computer program that plays the board game Go. It was developed by [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind "DeepMind") Technologies, a subsidiary of [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"). 

Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name [Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Master "AlphaGo Master"). After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as [AlphaGo Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero "AlphaGo Zero"), which was completely [self-taught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play_(reinforcement_learning_technique) "Self-play (reinforcement learning technique)") without learning from human games. 

AlphaGo Zero was then generalized into a program known as [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero "AlphaZero"), which played additional games, including [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess") and [shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi "Shogi"). AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as [MuZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuZero "MuZero") which learns without being taught the rules.
