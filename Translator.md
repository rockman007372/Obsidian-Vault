Hardware and Native program
- Processor: pointed rectangle, with architecture name (x86)
- Program: Mushroom, with source language written in
- Program written in the machine code of a hardware architecture is **native** to the architecture

2 translation tools:
- Compilers: high (level programming language) to low
- Decompiler: low to high

Special case of compiler/decompiler: Assemblers and deassemblers
- Assembler: assembler code to machine code (binary)
- Deassembler

Translator: 
- Translate programs written in one language to another
- Itself is a program written in a source language
