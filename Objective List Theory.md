- There are things that are objectively intrinsically good for a person, regardless of whether they want them or not
- Includes pleasure, knowledge, autonomy, friendship, achievements....
- ! [[Hedonism]] is a subset of Objective List Theory

Attractions:
- Explain the experience machine: other intrinsic goods not satisfied
- Explains why some desires are bad: satisfying these desires prevent them from achieving other intrinsic goods on the list

Objections:
- **Elistist**: life is bad if some people do not check all the boxes in the list
- What if the items on the list have sth in common (like pleasure) => does it mean only the intersection is intrinsically good?
