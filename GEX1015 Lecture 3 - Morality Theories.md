## Class note

- what makes an action morally right or wrong? Are there objective truths about morality?
- Definition:
	- Morally right = permissible action = ~(morally wrong)
		- morally required: actions that are wrong **not to perform** (keep promises)
		- morally super-erogatory: actions that are morally good but **not wrong to not perform** (jumping on grenade to save others)
		- morally neutral: "take philosophy class"
	- morrally wrong = impermissible action
- 2 theories:
	- Consequentialism
	- ??
## Consequentialism

- What determines the morality of an action depends ONLY on the consequences.
- [[Classic Utilitarianism]] is an example of consequentialism


# Tutorial
