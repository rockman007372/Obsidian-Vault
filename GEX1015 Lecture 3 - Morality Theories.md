# Class note

- What makes an action morally right or wrong? Are there objective truths about morality?
- Definition:
	- Morally right = permissible action = ~(morally wrong)
		- morally required: actions that are wrong **not to perform** (keep promises)
		- morally super-erogatory: actions that are morally good but **not wrong to not perform** (jumping on grenade to save others)
		- morally neutral: "take philosophy class"
	- Morally wrong = impermissible action
- 2 approach to determine morality:
	- Consequentialism
	- Non-consequentialism (not gonna go into deep details)
## Consequentialism

>[!definition]
> What determines the morality of an action depends ONLY on the consequences.

- [[Classic Utilitarianism]] is an example of consequentialism

## Non-consequentialism

>[!definition]
> It is not the case that whether an act is morally right or wrong depends ONLY on consequences (consequences are one of the factors)

We explore non-consequentialist approaches through the trolley problem.

Common intuitions in these 3 scenario:
- 2-way driver trolley problem: morally right to kill 1 person
- 2-way bystander trolley problem: morally right to let 1 person die
- Fat man trolley problem: morally wrong to kill the fat man

There are 3 non-consequentialist philosophers' attempt to explain the above common intuition:
- Kant: It is morally wrong to use a person **merely** as a mean (possible to be a mean, but not necessarily)
- Foot: Killing > letting die 
- Thompson: Negative duty > Positive duty

### Kant

- Kant's test for whether you are using someone merely as a means: imagine if the person is not there and to see if you could still achieve the same end
- In the Driver and Bystander problems, the one person is not a means because we can achieve our aim of saving the 5 people without the existence of the 1 person.
- Counter-argument: How about the loop problem?

### Foot

"Killing is worse than letting die". However, unable to explain the common intuition about the Bystander case: why is killing one more acceptable than letting 5 die?

### JJ Thompson

- tries to defend Foot's view
- argues that it is **morally wrong** to throw the switch in the Bystander case, **despite common intutition**
- Come up with the Bystander-3-way problem: can either kill 5, kill 1 or kill himself.
- argues that it is wrong to kill the 1 person in the 3 way problem: 
	- if you cannot kill urself to save the 5 people, how dare you sacrifice the other person instead?
	- even if u are altruistic, you cannot assume the other person is as altruistic as you.

>[!argument]
> - Premise 1: morally wrong to turn the trolley onto the person in Bystander 3 way
> - Premise 2: if it is morally wrong to turn the trolley in Bystader 3 way, it is morally wrong to turn the trolly in the Bystander 2 way.
> - Conclusion: **morally wrong to turn the trolly in the Bystander 2 way.**

- Why do most people think it is morally permissible to throw the switch? Because the means is not obvious in turning the switch as compared to pushing the fat man => However, there is no distinction in the means.
- Big idea: **negative duties outweighs positive duties.**
	- positive duties are the duties we have towards people in the form of aid
	- negative duties are the duties we have towards people in the form of non-interference
	- The negative duty to not kill the 1 person > the positive duty to save the 5 people.

Questions for Thompson:

1. What happens if there are more than 5 people on the track?
	1. Thompson is not a hardcore non-consequentialist like Kant. Adding more people adds weight to the consequences, which may affect her moral decisions.
2. In the 3 way problem, if you and the one person are not ready to bear the costs of turning the switch, why do you assume the 5 people are ready to bear the costs?
	1. Letting die < kill
	2. Thompson has no argument for Foot's "letting die < kill" principle.

- short term vs long term pleasure and pain in relation to classic utilitarianism? Needs a time frame.
