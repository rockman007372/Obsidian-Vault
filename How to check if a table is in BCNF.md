We use the simplified check: **More but not all**

>[!More but not all]
> If there is a closure $\set{A_{1}, A_{2},... A_{n}}^{+}$ that 
> 
> - contains some attribute not in $\set{A_1, A_2,... A_n}$ → "more"
> - but does not contain all attributes in the table → "but not all"
> 
> then the table is not in BCNF
