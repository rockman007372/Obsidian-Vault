- Store rows as vectors (a point in d-dimensions)
- Allow fast **similarity search**
	- Given a query, retrieve similar neighbors from the database
- Features: scalability, real time update, replication
- Use case:
	- Language models convert text into vectors (aka **embeddings**) => Vector DB allows quick search for similar embeddings.
