### Questions/Cues

### Notes

- PISA: Program for International Student **Assessment**
- PISA creates new ‘reference societies’ according to which politicians and educational policy-makers are pressurised to borrow ‘best’ educational policies and practices to boost the educational achievement level of their countries
- By defining the ‘crucial’ knowledge and skills needed for the twenty-first century and implying what educational policies will be rewarded, it exerts a considerable influence in shaping curricular emphases, programmes and pedagogical practices in various nations
- **High-performing education systems (HPES),** new emerging **education system** based on PISA top rankings and offer improvement tips for other systems.
- Singapore is a HPES - object of envy and emulation
- However, an over-preoccupation with PISA and ranking leads to missing out on the nature and purpose of education.

#### Factors contributing to high PISA rankings.

##### Teacher Quality
- Quality of teachers (often conflated with quality of teaching) is ensured and enhanced by high standards of recruitment, effective preparation programmes and opp. for professional development.
- Only top 30% of cohort can become teachers in Singapore

##### School Leadership
- high-quality school leadership developed through leadership experiences and professional development.
- identifying and selecting potential leaders for strong and often innovative **professional development programmes** 

##### System Characteristics
- such as academic expectations, standards, accountability measures
- accountability mechanisms such as school reviews, teacher evaluation and appraisal to sustain and improve teaching performance
- high equity systems: they believe that all students can learn and are committed to getting all students up to the appropriate expectations and standards -> **perversed growth mindset?**

##### Education Reform
- education reform’ directed towards the promotion of higher order thinking, creativity and independent learning.

#### Other Factors Unaccounted-for
- These factors are too generalised
- The purpose of HPSE is to allow "policy-borrowing" -> complexity of edu system has to be **reduced** to factors and issues found in every system, and can be solved by specific policies
- Many factors are unaccounted for, such as external factors beyond school and classrooms (cultural background, values, motivations, aspirations, resilience, learning strats...)
- Hence, HPES literature is lacking in careful consideration of the social, cultural and institutional contexts
- Lack of focus on **teaching ability**, too much on teacher quality
- Singapore, while having all the factors identified in HPSE literature, has other unique cultural and social factors as well.
  
#### Singapore

##### Post Colonial
- Post colonial education state:
	- acute underdevelopment and high unemployment rate
	- Socially divided - segregated schools
	- Post-secondary education limited, high drop out rate
- Political-linguistic settlement: English as main language with higher mother tongues -> recognition of necessity of English while still respecting language rights of ethnic groups.
- Uniform and common curriculum in english to replace old language based curricula.
- Centered on maths, sciences and languages, with technical subjects as supplement.
- Effective civic educations: understand the purpose and importance of nation building, cultivate civic responsibilities, and teach them to appreciate the desirable elements of both Eastern and Western traditions -> emphasis on civic duties compared to civil rights
- **Meritocracy**: academic grades were held as primary measures of the students’ ability and effort, irrespective of their social and economic backgrounds
- Free primary education in late 1970s
- HOWEVER, there were reports of high attrition rate, low literacy -> Singapore blamed ability differentials, NOT unreasonable curriculum standards and expectations -> **New education system in 1980:** The creation of different streams starting in primary school -> criticism on early asssement, negative labelling,...
- A national education system geared to the needs of an industrialising economy (*a larger proportion of students enrolled in polytechnics than in universities*) eventually took shape, supplanting the segmented system inherited from the colonial period.
- Why Sinagapore has high PISA ranking?
	- Education emphasis on math, science and language -> all 3 subjects in PISA
	- Meritocracy: High emphasis on academic performance and integrity in exchange for social mobility and rewards -> students, teachers, principals work very hard towards important gateways.
- Result of education reform: nation-wide obsession with excelling in examinations, tuition becomes a billion-dollar industry, teaching becomes geared towards transmission of curriculum content and ensuring exam performance.

##### Globalisation
- attempts were made to diversify educational provision and create flexibility through the establishment of multiple pathways, such as state-funded independent schools and later various categories of specialist schools with specialised curricular missions in the 2000s
- a plethora of reform initiatives have been rolled out to reduce emphasis on exam performance -> To little effect!! Lessons ‘were well-planned and well-managed, but rarely encouraged passionate pursuit of knowledge, higher-order thinking or open-ended interaction’.
- WHY? due to **teachers' traditional beliefs about knowledge, teaching and learning:**
	- knowledge = proved, ready made facts in curriculum, which are tested in national exams
	- teaching = passing these examinable knowledge, and 
	- learning = to memorize and practice these knowledge for exams 
	- ideas reinforced by tuition industry + high-grip assessment system

#### PISA Paradox
- The Asian education model is largely conservative, directed towards the transmission of predetermined content and skills and examination performance
- PISA claimed to be strongly forward-looking and future-oriented, with the ambition of testing skills and competencies in authentic contexts deemed essential for life and work in the twenty-first century
- YET, Asian countries perform well → Conclusion: **PISA is bogus**
- What PISA tests actually measure are ‘competencies related to solving academic types of problems which … are not predefined by academic knowledge'

### Summary
Such an Asian education model contributes to Asian students’ high rankings in PISA in three respects. 
- First, PISA happens to test skills and content in precisely the three curriculum areas – mathematics, science and reading – stressed in the centralised modern curriculum.
- Second, a national high-stakes examination, by virtue of its considerable institutional authority, steers classroom practice towards the transmission of knowledge and examination performance which in part contributes to high PISA results. 
- Third, since examinations are the primary determiner of educational success and economic careers, teachers are more inclined to teach to examinations, and students are motivated to learn material that will be tested and take such examinations seriously.
