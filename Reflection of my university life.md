# Reflection of my university life

### Feelings
I have been supressing my hinest feelings about university. After 1 year of university life, all I feel is a sense of unfulfilment and loneliness. To understand my feelings, I must revisit my initial goals and aspirations before entering uni. My main priorities in uni are result, friendship and soft skills, in that order of importance. There is no denying that I have very high expectations for my grades. Having sailed through A level with stellar result, I was hoping my university result would follow suits. It did not. I struggled so hard in the first semester, and felt so helpless with my results. It felt like I have put in so much effort and time into my study, yet it was never paying off.  I would always enter the exam with an anxiety ridden mind and a palpitating heart. Exam questions gave me an unfarmiliar sense of helplessness and desperation. I dreaded exams. Then come the hollow and gruelling expectations of result. I knew I underperformed, yet my heart yearns for good result. I was hoping, praying for some miracles, that my grades returned way above average, that in fact I was still "the cream of the crop", commanding respect and awe from everyone. The result always came back to the contrary. Before long, my confidence cracked and buckled under my immense expectations, and through seeped the insecured and anxious thoughts. The loss of confidence affects me in all aspect of life. It pulled me away from my brilliant friends who achieved much more academic success. It leaks into my conversation, causing me great unease around confident and successful people. This only further obliterate my already weak social presence. The time invested in studying comes with the massive opportunity cost of not having any time for social interactions. I barely went out of uni with anyone. All my relationships are superficial. I felt like I did not make a strong impression on anyone? Do I have to? I am not sure anymore. The first year was very important in establishing connections and making friendship, but it felt as if I blew a lot of chances to do so. Of course, my social and soft skills saw no imrovement consequentially. Out of all the initial goals, I achieved none. 

### Reasons 
##### Study:
- My study methods were NOT TIME EFFICIENT. Watching lectures take too much time as I keep getting distracted by the phone and bed. Taking notes also takes a lot of time due to my perfectionistic desire for pleasant looking notes.
- I procrastinate too much. Always telling myself i can finish the lecture or an assignment the next day. My phone usage was insanely high, *especially at night.* 
- I have accrued a lot of bad habits over the year. Bad phone usage is the biggest culprit.
- My knowledge is not deep. I had superficial understanding of course content. Taking notes is far from enough. I need *practice*. 

##### Relationship
- I shy away from meeting new people? Im not really sure. I do welcome social interactions, but every now and then I feel like im not contributing any worthy ideas to the conversation. Probably consciousness issues. Stemming from confidence. 
- Feel like Im not humourous enough? Do i even have to be? Not really, more of like mismatched sense of humour.  A more social person would not have this problem? Am i thinking about others too much? Probably
- I also speak very fast when im excited. SLOW DOWN!
  
### Solutions
- Cant be putting off lectures. I couldnt focus on revision and practice BECAUSE im not caught up with lectures. MUST ESTABLISH HABIT OF WATCHING LECTURE. (Thank god lectures will be physical?).
- More efficient note taking. -> care less about appearances. Its about the content! Cornell method seems very efficient right now. Dont care abt form! Care about understanding. Form comes when you do revision notes. 
- Use Notion or ant calendar app to keep track of exams time. Must revise AT LEAST 1 WEEK IN ADVANCE. 
- Dont run away. You have the lifelong habit of retreating into your lifeless and indulgent shell when you feel down. Bad grades? Depress mode. ED? Im gonna lie down and watch youtube for 10 straight hours. What help does that do? Its difficult, so difficult tho...
- Lets lock some apps.
- Lacking motivation? Come back here. 
- Keep a growth mindset. I have NOT reached my ceiling. I can do this. Believe you can get even better right now
